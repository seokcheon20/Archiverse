# Readme 😁

Hi, this is the repo for the website https://quartz.eilleeenz.com/. This was made with Quartz, and I kept the original readme below (which includes a link to get started yourself). Say hi in my [guestbook](https://github.com/fanteastick/quartz-test/discussions/21)!

# Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.

The subjective mental or physical effort required to access a tool that you already have. This is less tied to OS than resistance, and can vary by tool or environment.

If something is low-friction, it gets used, and used often. As a matter of fact, the reason I've swapped around so much for my notes solution is because I've been trying to find something low-friction. [[Projects/Obsidian/digital-garden|Quartz]] appealed to me for this website simply because it was low friction and I could author content right out of my notetaker. 
- For example, [[Programs I Like/obsidian|Obsidian]] is more feature rich than the alternatives while being more accessible.

This article is somewhat of a glossary for all the words/phrases that I use that originate with Linux or related projects like GNU. Many of the terms here can be found in [The Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/). I don't just link to that because it's absolutely massive, but it's a very fun read through if you're interested in how people have talked about computing in the past.

## On Acronyms
Unix LOVES their acronyms. `ls`? LiSt. `cat`? conCATenate. `grep`?  Globular Regular Expression Print. Many commands and programs were designed to be typed quickly in the early days of computing, and holdovers persist to this day.

This is my brain's approach to problems, as I understand it. It's like that section in a scientific paper where the authors describe their method. 
## Method
### Programming
Many of my mental tricks here are just a faster version of writing the algï»¿orithms out on a whiteboard or a sticky note. It's a skill I picked up in undergrad.

I think in terms of visual motion a lot. I typically think of windows and slices as the matrix notation brackets actually moving in space through a field of inputs. If I have to iterate around the field, I picture a 'caret' of sorts at the current step. 

### Writing
I try to maintain a rigid epistemology of correcting incorrect information and removing or at least acknowledging my biases as much as I can. That extends to this site; [[Misc/disclaimers#Epistemological disclosure|read more here]]. If you're looking to build this as your own habit, there's a collection of [Street Epistemology Questions](https://helentracy.com/Reference/Street-Epistemology-Questions) (link broken but unarchived, sad) that could help.

Style and tone vary heavily. Rightfully so; different audiences prefer different types of content. On this site, I write to persuade or inform the interested generalist, in an [academish voice](https://inkandswitch.notion.site/Academish-Voice-0d8126b3be5545d2a21705ceedb5dd45). 
- Sidebar: I go a bit further than the academic style of the above link. I attempt to faithfully characterize even the strongest arguments against my position, and not just cherry-pick the weakest arguments to make my own look more persuasives.

Resistance is the subjective difficulty involved with installing new tools. In simpler terms, it's how much of a fight your computer puts up. I believe that your computer should adapt to you, rather than the other way around, which is a major part of the reason why I use linux.

For example, Windows is very high-resistance in general: finding an executable for the tool (hopefully portable, otherwise it's an installer which is even more resistance), putting it in the correct place, and potentially dealing with UAC to authorize where you put it or to allow it to run properly.

It goes without saying that package managers alleviate resistance significantly. A single source for no-nonsense installs of almost everything you need!

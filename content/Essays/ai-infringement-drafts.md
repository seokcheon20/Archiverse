## Putting your work "out there" on the internet
Artist's will, don't exploit
### Detour: plagiarism
There's also the problem of correctly sourcing information used in forming an opinion.

One proposed "solution" to AI use of copyrighted works is interestingly to cite those works used in generating an answer. But I actually think an anti-plagiarism argument that I disagree with regarding human work finds footing here. I talked about the *reductio ad absurdum* point in [[Essays/plagiarism#The Anti-Plagiarism Argument: Response to Frye|üÖøÔ∏è my response to Frye on plagiarism]]...
## Economics
WIP

One point: I've refuted the technical underpinnings of one of the biggest purported value adds, ie summaries. What does that do to the optics of AI from a business standpoint?

### What these incentives teach us
At the end of the day, these policy arguments are here to suggest what direction the law should move in. To solve the economic "half" of the AI problem, what about a different kind of commercial right? Something more trademark than copyright. ==use of expression; remedies too==
## The enforcement problem
There are many roadblocks to bringing an action in infringement against either a user or an AI proprietor. Do the general policy points behind these roadblocks still hold in an AI context?
## Building universal truth
What makes truth as stated by humans different from fact-shaped output by AI?

Statistically, what level of confidence will we accept as truth, and can AI get there?

I really want to engage with other thinkers about authoritative information on this point. Molly White, if you're out there: how does it feel to be a significant contributor to what may become the last authoritative factual source on the internet?

## Ethics
Why is piracy ethical, but not AI training?

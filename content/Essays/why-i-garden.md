## Short answer: fun.

I don't get to write stream-of-consciousness in my day-to-day, or to document arbitrary technical problems and how I've solved them. This is an outlet for that.

## Long Answer

There are a lot of beautiful rabbit holes on the internet if you know where to look. Wikis for arbitrary fandoms, project websites, blogs, the like. I want to be one of those, or at least a starting point for someone to find a rabbit hole.

The kind of experience I want to be a part of has some history on the early internet. Originally, there was a vocal minority pushing for this sort of unguided exploration, supplemented only by signposts of where one *could* travel from a given page, instead of where one *should* travel [[#1.|(1)]].

It's also a very practical process. Documenting my mental state means that I'm much more likely to have a fully formed opinion on the subject I'm writing about. I like being able to talk about things, and as someone who struggles with articulating myself on-the-fly, it's helpful that I've cemented my talking points by writing them out. Not to mention, it allows me to critically examine my own views like any other's. The mental disconnect between words in the format you write them ([[Projects/Obsidian/editor|Obsidian]]) and their appearance in another medium ([[Projects/Obsidian/digital-garden|Quartz]]) helps me with both editing and analysis; I picked up that skill from my legal writing mentors.

## Epistemological disclosure
Please accept that I reserve the right to be wrong on this website. I don’t claim to be an expert on any of the subject matter within. As this site reflects a learning process, I’m also liable to change my mind if I research an issue further. I’ll document if this happens. 

If you don’t like how I’ve done something, feel free to write a piece in your own garden for it. I’d love to read it! It’s no secret that a lot of this garden comprises my gripes with various things. 
## Disclaimer
- It goes without saying that anything herein constitutes my own opinion and not the opinion of any affiliated person or entity, such as my employer or their business relationships.

## Attribution
Feel free to properly reference any of the content within in your own gardens or work. Don’t plagiarize. A link to the page you used is just fine.

**Do not input my work into an online or offline generative AI for any purpose, including to train or update the model, explore alternate positions to mine, or to converse with the work.**
- If you need an alternative explanation to understand my argument, please ask me! I run this site to practice explaining these topics. 
- If you @ me with "I asked chatgpt the same question and here's what it said", it's going to say more about your ability to effectively converse on these subjects than it will about the merits of the AI's position.

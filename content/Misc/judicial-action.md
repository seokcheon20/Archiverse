If the King's Courts could not enforce a legal/compensatory remedy (usually by some technicality), the courts of equity could still provide a remedy at equity.

Now, people have many more rights which have no founding in common law. They exist because they were written into existence through statutes or the Constitution, including our modern concept of civil rights.

It's why Facebook banning you isn't a violation of your free speech rights, among other things. i.e., the wrong for which you seek a remedy must be an action taken by the State, not a private entity.

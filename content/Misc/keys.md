Take a look at this typewriter:

The keys are connected by levers to the internal workings. Those levers have to be spaced apart so that they don't collide, and to ensure smooth typing. More in-depth explanation (off-site) [here](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Staggering#Classic%20typewriter%20keyboard).

The modern keyboard stagger, with some exceptions, overwhelmingly looks like this:

But there are no levers in an electronic keyboard. Why the design holdover? We only staggered the keys in a typewriter because they physically couldn't be aligned any other way. And nobody nowadays has typed on a typewriter necessitating familiarity.

The answer? Comfort. Typing on a keyboard like that below, unless you're actively tucking your elbows in at your sides, is completely unbearable:

So the staggered layout remains. 

##### P.S.
Yes, [split ortholinear](https://keeb.io/collections/split-keyboards/products/viterbi-keyboard-pcbs-5x7-70-split-ortholinear) and other enthusiast layouts like [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) exist that alter or eliminate the above concerns. This is just meant to be a minimal example of when necessity stumbles upon a highly performant solution by chance.

Unorganized personal impressions of the USCO guidances on AI. Part of a series on [[Atomic/gen-ai|generative AI]]. As usual, **this isn't a substitute for legal advice.**
## Part 2: Generated Output
P. 12: I disagree with where they've drawn the line of copyrightability here. An outline isn't the AI making expressive choices, yet a full story is? And why are we calling it "expressive choices" at all when that term sounds in creativity, which the office elsewhere establishes is not what's taking place?

P. 13: the idea of prompts being copyrightable is strange to me. They're purely functional expressions fed to a machine to produce an output, not even analogous to computer code imo. Revisions aren't for artistic iteration, they're for closer alignment with the desired functionality! "give me a coffee. Sorry, I mean give me a venti iced caramel macchiato" isn't copyrightable...

P. 20 is excellent, shows a good understanding of the tech.

P. 23 is a fair edgecase but it seems totally useless to register the AI work like that because the office only granted registration of the parts attributable to the drawing

P. 26-27 I'm not certain that this is an edge case, why are these not treated the same as AI-art compilations (ie you have copyright in your arrangement only)?

I agree entirely with the incentive section, I think it treats the competition factor with a ton of respect, and disability as an edge case is perfect

## Part 3: Training Data
I'm very excited for this part given my high opinion of Part 2.

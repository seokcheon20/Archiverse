This is a list of programs which I may or may not have experience with, and why I have a positive regard for them. 

Generally, I adore any tool with a community-based ecosystem that has some component which can be deployed on a server of your choosing. This isolates your data from the data of others and keeps it out of the public eye. Nerdy!

## Anything self-hosted.
- [[on-self-hosted-software|On Self-Hosted Software]]
- [[Programs I Like/on-the-fediverse|On the Fediverse]]
## Catppuccin.
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) is a coffee-flavored theme ecosystem for just about everything. 
## The Hundred Rabbits ecosystem.
- [[Programs I Like/hundred-rabbits|Hundred Rabbits]] is a collective that creates tools, games, and music while sailing around the world.
- They've made several toy programs that I enjoy playing with as well as some neat minimal tools for their own personal computing system called [Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html).
## Linux.
- 'nuff said.
- [[Essays/on-linux|On Linux]]
## Suckless software
- https://suckless.org/ is a wonderful resource for in-depth explanations of why a certain piece of software [sucks](https://suckless.org/sucks/) or [rocks](https://suckless.org/rocks/). However, it's limited to a very specific set of programs. 
- This category typically includes highly flexible pieces of software that I affectionately refer to as "configuration hell." If you're not breaking your entire install every time you want to view a new filetype, you're doing it wrong.
- Here are some strictly software projects, as well as my quick thoughts on each (with a more in-depth explanation sometimes available):
	- [[Programs I Like/code-editors#Neovim|Neovim]], the blazingly fast and highly-configurable terminal text editor. 
## Programming languages?
- [[functional-programming|Functional programming]] is my favorite paradigm.

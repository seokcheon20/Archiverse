Hundred Rabbits has a collection of programs and APIs that reflect the kind of project base I really like. Here are the highlights.

## About
Hundred Rabbits is actually just two people, Rek and Devine, and they're just so cool. They both have Mastodon accounts that you can follow them on, found [here](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html). Devine's about programming (though they also do some art and have previously released music), and Rek is a writer. They sail around the world on a craft named Pino.

## Tools
### Uxn
[Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) is the primary crown jewel of the 100R ecosystem. It's an extremely lightweight operating system designed to run on absolutely anything (kind of a necessity when your equipment is constantly surrounded by seawater). So many little useful programs and a few games exist for this system. My favorites:
- **Noodle**: Remember Flipnote studio? This is almost like that for stills. Super simple and cute!
- **Orca**: esolang. In another life, I loved these things.
- **Nasu**: 8-bit sprite editor
- **Left**: Fully featured text editor for making Uxn programs.
- **Adelie**: Presentations
### The Rest
- (old) [Ecosystem Theme](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes): a theme framework for your apps. Aeriform TAPE, mentioned in the [[productivity#On your computer|productivity essay]], uses this system, and you can clone this repo for some free themes for it. Tape is actually how I discovered 100R!
## Games
- [Oquonie](https://100r.co/site/oquonie.html): textless isometric Uxn game about moving through rooms that defy physics. Very bizarre, and reminds me of Yume Nikki. Really good.
- [Paradise](https://100r.co/site/paradise.html): more of a sandbox with a set of rules than a game. Create named things, assign them behaviors with an in-universe scripting language, and create things inside them. Create spells to automate your actions. You can tell your own stories inside Paradise.
	- I use mine as a sort of trophy room of my favorite memories, imagined as physical items in a display cabinet with flavor text attached.
	- The base version is slightly broken. Most performant version I've found is [Mobandon's fork](https://github.com/Mobandon/Paradise), which also adds dialogue.

> [!hint]
> I'm looking for a more performant version of Paradise than Mobandon's, with a working version of the original LISP-based embedded scripting language. If you find one, comment!

I recently started looking into the ideology behind the fediverse. Long story short, I like what I see, and will be looking into a project with it soon.

I started my journey on [fedi.tips](https://fedi.tips/). This is a huge site with mountains of content explaining the fediverse and troubleshooting various hosting/usage issues. The videos linked are really cool.

## The Ideas
### Decentralization
Normally, when I hear "decentralized", my brain goes **straight** to the last tech scam, a la Web3 and cryptocurrency. I always found myself wishing, "why doesn't someone take the really cool principles embodied by crypto and completely divorce them from crypto?" Well, that's what the fediverse seeks to do. I like it!
## The Reality
I made a Mastodon account recently, and I'm blown away by how functional it is. The protocol itself has its issues, but it's shockingly simple Ruby which means I can start contributing to it as soon as I get time. Maybe I'll start with its RSS feeds.

In terms of the actual user experience, I found the Glitch (aka glitch-soc) fork to have some great additions to the protocol. Markdown support in toots is an absolute must for me (you could never tell that I enjoy Markdown, what are you talking about I don't take notes in it or write a site in it or anything). 

I knew about it going in, but was still blown away by how seamless federation with non-mastodon Fediverse ecosystems is insane. Pixelfed and Lemmy are both near perfect at crossposting.

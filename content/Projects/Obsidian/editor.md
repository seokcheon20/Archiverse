Where the hell do I start with this. It's almost as convoluted and fine-tuned as my [[Programs I Like/code-editors|Code Editors]]. This is by no means a complete or current list, I just want to highlight some of the things I've done that have improved Obsidian's usefulness to me.

## Appearance
### Theme
Anuppuccin: I already like the [[Programs I Like/home#Catppuccin|Catppuccin]] ecosystem, and this theme adds interop with a few different plugins as well as major customization potential through [[#Style Settings]]. 
## Plugins
These are the edits I found worth noting. All can be found through Obsidian's community plugin browser.
#### Self-hosted LiveSync
Cross-platform notes, for free. I have a full page on this plugin's backend setup [[Projects/Obsidian/livesync|here]]. How cool is it to be able to write for this website from my phone??
#### Shell Commands
This thing rocks. From my laptop, I can tell Quartz to push any local changes to [[Projects/Obsidian/digital-garden|this website]] just by running a custom command from the [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette). No need to open the terminal.
#### Style Settings
Configure supported themes.
#### Tasks
Adds a whole new query type called a task block for you to keep track of customizable tasks with variable content, state, priority, and due date. Compatible with a host of themes as well.

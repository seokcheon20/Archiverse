Hoo boy. This project needs its entire own folder structure because of the sheer amount of components I have going.

This homepage has no difficulty tag because each of the below is different.

I think my use is divided into three easily separable parts:
- [[editor|Editor]]: What I've done to the Obsidian application itself. 
- [[livesync|LiveSync]]: My use of the `Obsidian-LiveSync` plugin to encrypt, obfuscate, and back up *all* of my notes to [[my-cloud|My Cloud]]. 
	- These are accessible from any device that can run an Obsidian client.
	- I just use it currently on my laptop and phone.
- [[digital-garden|Digital Garden]]: This website. 
	- It's secretly just run out of a folder in my ^ LiveSync'ed notes repository that I have [[Atomic/symlink|symlinked]] into my laptop's local repository for Quartz.

[usememos/memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) is another knowledge collection-oriented project, albeit with a slightly different audience to [[Programs I Like/obsidian|Obsidian]].

Setting it up acquainted me with [Docker](https://docker.com), and now `docker-compose` .

I used it as my cross-platform notes app for a few months, but it eventually fell out of favor because that’s not its intended purpose and it was clunky as a result. 

### Final Thoughts
Memos works best with a network of people sharing ideas with communal tags. A use case I could see is an entire graduate department collaborating in various groups over memos, informing each group of the others’ research, or grant applications, or other info. Think memo in the "internal memorandum" sense. Aggregation of starting points in a less transitory format than a true notes app.

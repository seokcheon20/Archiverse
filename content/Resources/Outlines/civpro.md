{ *Any statutes and federal rules mentioned are available for free online, usually through LII. Just google them -ed.* }
## The Personal Jurisdiction Checklist
- { *This is a repetition of information set out in more conventional outline format below used as a quick reference -ed.* }
1. If any of the below apply: no minimum contacts required, jurisdiction is valid
	- D implicitly consented to the exercise of jurisdiction (_Hess_)
	- D domiciled within the state
	- D personally served within the state (_Burnham_)
	- Suit arose out of attachment of property, **directly related** to property (_in rem_ or most admiralty, _cf._ _Pennoyer_)
	- Forum selection clause or choice-of-law provision that **reasonably** permits suit in this forum (_Burger King_, _Carnival Cruise_)
2. If none of the above apply, look to the long-arm statute (_McGee_):
	- California-type (any exercise consistent with DPC)
	    - Apply minimum contacts test
	- Illinois-type (any act on this list is consent to personal jurisdiction)
	    - Interpreted as illustrative (typical) and like a Cali-type?
	        - Minimum contacts test
	    - Interpreted as exhaustive?
	        - On list? Minimum contacts test now (_WW VW_)
	        - Not on list? No jurisdiction (but still do minimum contacts test for the points)
	- Hybrid (any act on this list or consistent with dpc)
	    - Minimum contacts test
3. The below do not affect the validity of exercise of personal j
	- Unilateral activity within a state by d (_Helicopteros, Hanson_)
	- State is ‘center of gravity’ of litigation (_Hanson_)
	- All P did was cause an effect in the state _(Kulko_)
	- Fortuitous circumstances (instrumentality moved by p) (_WW VW_)
	- Chattel as an agent for service of process (_WW VW_)
	- Lack of foreseeability of suit, especially if the facts indicate intent to submit to sovereign authority (_Nicastro_)
	- Applicable law may be affected, such as the First Amendment (_Calder_)
	- P’s contacts/lack thereof with the forum state (_Keeton_)
	- A foreign corporation not at home in the US (_Goodyear_, _Daimler_)
4. Examine the “relationship between the defendant, the forum state, and the litigation” (_WW VW_)
	- Does the suit arise out of the activity within the state (specific jurisdiction)? If so, look for:
	    - Corporation enjoying “benefits and protections of the laws” (_Amer Radiator_)
	    - Products enjoying “substantial use and consumption” (_Amer Radiator_)
	    - “affiliating circumstances” affecting the reasonability of the litigation (_WW VW_)
	        - Burden on d of litigating in the forum
	        - P’s interest in convenient relief
	        - State’s interest in suit
	        - Interstate judiciary’s interest in resolving the dispute
	        - Shared interest of multiple states to further social policy (effectively do we want to favor plaintiffs and expand their access to recovery)
	    - Was the **defendant’s** activity what connected them to the forum (_Walden_)?
	    - placing products in stream of commerce **plus** other “purposeful availment” to suit (_Asahi_, _Nicastro_)
	    - a contract **plus** some actions to establish the transaction is not random/fortuitous (_Burger King_)
	    - child corporation so under the control of a parent that it is the parent’s alter ego _(Daimler_)
	- Are the claims unrelated to the activity (general jurisdiction)? If so, look for:
	    - Systematic and continuous contacts within the forum state (_International Shoe_, _Helicopteros_) 
## Choice of Forum
- Strategic concerns
    - Jury pool
        - Location, opinion, and tightness
    - Relationship to judge
    - Procedural rules
    - Public opinion
    - Docket congestion
- Legal concerns
    - FRCP 12(b): motions to dismiss on…
    - Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction, 12(b)(1)
        - “If the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, they have no authority to adjudicate the claims and defenses.”
        - CANNOT WAIVE DEFECTS IN subject-matter jurisdiction, IF NO subject-matter jurisdiction THEN NO CASE
        - Diversity Jurisdiction
            - “28 U.S.C. 1332: A federal court has jurisdiction over cases where the parties are citizens of different sovereigns and the amount in controversy is over <statutory limit currently $75k>.”
                - O: _Strawbridge v. Curtiss_ (1806): complete diversity rule
                - Individuals
                    - _Mas v. Perry_ (1974, 5th cir): domicile is where you intend to return to, if you don’t establish a new domicile you absolutely intend to return to your old one. One domicile is your citizenship, many residences don’t matter.
                - Corporations
                    - 28 usc 1332(c)(1): Corp is citizen of state where it is incorporated and where its principal place of business is
                    - _Hertz Corp. v. Friend_ (2010, Breyer)
                        - principal place of business is the nerve center, usually where the corporation’s officers direct the corporation’s activity from
                        - Total activity test is complex and leads to strange results
                        - Forms filed by corp are not enough for citizenship to be established (SEC 10-K listing principal offices)
                - Partnerships
                    - _Rose_: citizen of every state the partners are citizens of
                - Unincorporated associations
                    - _Rose_: citizen of every state the members are citizens of
                - Parties joined for some purpose of establishing or defeating federal j
                    - 28 usc 1359: no jurisdiction over action where party was joined for the purpose of giving jurisdiction (collusive joinder)
                    - _Kramer v. Caribbean Mills_ (1969, Harlan)
                        - Business transfer followed by suit with some retention of some interest in the suit by transferor can be collusive joinder
                        - If no interest retained, definitely no collusive joinder
                    - 28 usc 1359: court cannot hear cases where parties were joined for the sole purpose of conferring j
                    - _Rose v. Giamatti_ (1989, s.d. ohio)
                        - cannot defeat removal jurisdiction by adding nondiverse parties
                        - For diversity jurisdiction purposes, only actual parties with interest in the suit are considered, no nominal parties
        - Federal Question Jurisdiction
            - “28 U.S.C. 1331: A federal court has jurisdiction over cases arising out of the constitution, laws, and treaties of the united states.”
                
                - _Amer. Nat’l Red Cross v. S.G. & A.E._ (1992, Souter)
                    
                    - sue-or-be-sued provisions in congressional charters that mention the federal judiciary convey original jurisdiction as well as capacity to sue
                        
                - _T.B. Harms Co._ _v. Eliscu_ (1964, 2nd cir): A case may arise under a law if it turns on an interpretation of that law or the law creates the claim (contract claim with copyright as subject does not arise under Copyright Act)
                    
                - Turns on an interpretation
                    
                    - _Louisville & Nashville Ry. v. Mottley_ (1908, Moody): The federal question must appear on the face of the well-pleaded complaint; asserting in your complaint that the defendant may make a defense and then responding to that defense with the constitution or federal law does not mean arising under j
                        
                    - _Grable & Sons Metal Products v. Darue Engrg_ (2005, Souter)
                        
                        - An essential element of a claim depending on whether a fed statute was violated does convey federal-question jurisdiction, regardless of whether the action itself is from state law
                            
                        - This doesn’t affect existing suits because of how rare it is
                            
                - Law creates the claim
                    
                    - _Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals v. Thompson_ (1986, Stevens)
                        
                        - Four factors involved in fed statutes that create cause of action
                            
                            - P part of the class for whose special benefit the law was passed
                                
                            - Congressional purpose was to provide cause of action
                                
                            - Cause of action would further the purposes of the legislation
                                
                            - Cause of action is not traditionally relegated to state law
                                
                        - No federal interest in the suit and thus no purpose served by adjudicating it in federal court when it doesn’t have express federal-question jurisdiction
                            
                        - P: _Kansas City Title & Trust_: resolution of state claim turning on interpretation of federal statute allows subject-matter jurisdiction (distinguished from the instant case)
                            
                    - _Grable & Sons Metal Products v. Darue Engrg_ (2005, Souter): state law claims turning on an interpretation of a federal law convey subject-matter jurisdiction implicly, doesn’t overrule _Merrell Dow,_ just adds a test
                        
        - Supplemental Jurisdiction
            
            - “When two claims arise out of the same case and controversy, one conferring original jurisdiction and the other not, the federal courts have supplemental jurisdiction over the latter claim.”
                
                - 28 USC 1367: codification of black letter from below prior cases, see scheme
                    
                - _Exxon Mobil v. Allapattah Servs._ (2005, Kennedy): as long as class representatives’ claims meet amount in controversy, entire class can be adjudicated over under 1367 if they meet the other diversity requirement
                    
            - “When federal and state claims both arise out of a common nucleus of operative fact, the federal courts have pendent-claim jurisdiction over the state claim.”
                
                - _UMW v. Gibbs_ (1966, Brennan): examine relationship of claims, convenience, and fairness of litigating state claim in federal court
                    
                - P: _Hurn_: state law claims can be heard in fed ct if they parallel the federal questions (broadened in _Gibbs_)
                    
            - “When a suit is brought against some parties with good jurisdictional basis and some parties with no jurisdictional basis, if the claims against each are not substantially different, the federal courts have pendent-party jurisdiction over the unjustified claims.”
                
                - 1367, of course
                    
                - _Finley v. U.S._ (1989, Scalia)
                    
                    - **OVERRULED** by _Exxon_ and 1367: courts cannot exercise pendent-party jurisdiction when one d has a fed claim and one d (pendent party) has a state claim
                        
                        - P: _Aldinger_: federal claims and state claims must not substantially differ to establish pendent jurisdiction
                            
                        - One party’s claims being state and the other federal is a substantial difference
                            
                    - If no independent jurisdictional basis exists over the pendent parties, cannot establish pendent-party j
                        
                        - P: _Owen_: must have diversity jurisdiction to exercise pendent jurisdiction
                            
                    - If Congress doesn’t like this body of law they can fix it themselves (**f o r e s h a d o w i n g**)
                        
            - “A defendant can implead any third party with whom they have a claim logically dependent upon the resolution of the case in chief under the federal court’s ancillary jurisdiction.” (3pc is ancillary jurisdiction)
                
                - Judicial economy and convenience considerations
                    
                - _Owen Equipment & Erection v. Kroger_ (1978, Stewart)
                    
                    - 3rd party complaint has to be logically dependent on the case-in-chief
                        
                    - Complete diversity is required even after amending pleading to join impleaded party
                        
                    - Judicial economy/convenience cannot justify extending ancillary jurisdiction to cover p’s claims against impleaded party as well
                        
        - Removal Jurisdiction

            - _Carlsbad Tech v. HIF Bio_ (2009, Thomas): lacking jurisdiction and choosing not to use jurisdiction under 1367(c) are distinct, discretionary remands are reviewable

            - RCP 14 (impleader/third-party practice)
                
    - Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, 12(b)(2)
        
        - “In order for a court to issue a binding decision over a defendant, they must have good personal jurisdiction over that defendant, otherwise the decision is invalid and void.”

                - Physical presence within the state (general jurisdiction)
                    
                    - (This is the justification for sovereignty over residents)
                        
                - Personal service within the state

                - Implied consent to personal jurisdiction
                    
                    - _Hess v. Pawloski_, specific j
                        
                        - States may enact and enforce regulations extending jurisdiction that promote their public interest (such as encouraging exercise of care in one’s action), as long as they do not discriminate unfairly against nonresidents.
                            
                - Minimum contacts
                    
                    - “Personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants only requires certain minimum contacts be established with the state.”
                        
                        - Must be consistent with “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice”

                                - One contact can be enough to establish minimum contacts if court wishes to protect state’s interests in its residents
                                    
                                - State has strong interest in protecting residents from insurance companies

                                - Simply being the center of gravity of a suit (majority of parties reside there) does not give a state jurisdiction over all parties
                                    
                            - _Kulko v. Super. Ct. of Cali._ (1978, sup ct): Simply causing an effect in a state does not give j

## Pleading

- “Pleading should not be a battle of wits.”
    
    - _Dioguardi v. Durning_ (1957, 2nd cir): the rcp were created so that plaintiffs wouldn’t be thrown out of court for most mistakes in pleadings
        
    - _Conley v. Gibson_ (1957, Black): Overruled: can only dismiss 12(b)(6) if p has alleged no set of facts that would entitle to recover, only needs a short and plain statement of general facts which could prove a violation of some duty (aka ‘notice pleading’)
        
    - _Bell Atlantic v. Twombly_ (2007, Souter): can dismiss 12(b)(6) if the claim in the pleadings is not plausible on its face, must have enough factual heft to nudge complaint over the line from possible to **plausible**
        
    - _Ashcroft v. Iqbal_ (2009, Kennedy): there is no “flexible” standard, plausible is plausible, _Twombly_ applies to everything not just antitrust
        
- “Responsive pleadings must be clear in what is denied and what is claimed.”
    
    - _PAE Gov’t v. MPRI_ (2007, 9th cir): contradicting earlier pleadings is allowed in amended complaints, if you dismiss on grounds of contradiction you’re looking at the merits of the claim during the pleading and that’s disallowed
        
    - _Garcia v. Hilton Hotels_ (1951, Puerto Rico fed district)
        
        - If it could reasonably be conceived at trial that the claim is true, sufficiently pleaded
            
        - Conditional privilege does not evidence failure to state a claim like absolute privilege does
            
    - _Rubert-Torres v. Hospital San Pablo_ (2000, 1st cir): Not every attachment to 12(c) warrants conversion under 12(d), but attaching papers that argue the merits of the motion with evidence outside the pleadings warrants conversion
        
    - _Zielinski v. PPI_ (1956): answers must make clear to p what is being presented, and if the answers mislead p as to who the correct defendant is, equitable estoppel may permit the claims as a punishment.
        
    - NOTE ON DEFENSES: if p can determine what d is referring to in p’s claims when d asserting defenses, they’re good even if conclusory (logical ambit test)
        
- “Amending pleadings can prevent dismissal.”
    
    - Important dichotomy
        
        - If you object to a variance, p can seek leave to amend
            
        - If you do not object to a variance, p can move at the end of trial to amend under 15(b)(2) and add claims better supported by the evidence presented to the pleading
            
        - Reconcile: still better to object so you can defend against the claims
            
    - _Krupski v. Costa Crociere_ (2010, Sotomayor)
        
        - Know-or-should-have-known refers to d, not p (p can still make mistake with knowledge)
            
        - Undue delays (dilatory conduct) don’t determine mistake for relation-back doctrine
            
- “Failure to comply with what is expected of a pleading can subject the parties, the lawyers, or their law firms to sanctions.”
    
    - 28 usc 1927: unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of proceedings can cause monetary sanctions for costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred due to the conduct
        
    - _Roth v. Green_ (2006, 10th cir): Must comply w rule 11 TO THE LETTER for sanctions to be proper, 1927 sanctions are relaxed
        
    - P: _Vanderhoff v. Pacheko_: 927 is for intentional wrong, 11 is for negligence
        
- “Counterclaims need not establish an independent basis for jurisdiction.”
    
    - If you don’t bring compulsory counterclaims when required, barred _res judicata_
        
    - _Jones v. FoMo Credit Co._ (2004): Compulsory counterclaims are ancillary (rule 13 transaction or occurrence test of compulsivity for j, if it’s a good counterclaim it has good jurisdiction), permissive counterclaims may be supplemental (section 1367 one case test for jurisdiction so long as no discretionary dismissal factors are acted on)
        
        - P: _Moore v. N.Y. Cotton_ (1926, sup ct): “arising-out-of” is a logical relation test
            
        - More subjectively, same witnesses and evidence? Hear the claims together for efficiency
            
    - _LASA v. Alexander_ (1969, 6th cir)
        
        - the “transaction” is not a literal transaction/contract, is the situation as a whole
            
        - Any crossclaim or 3pc that passes the logical-relation arising-out-of test is ancillary
            
- “Joinder of parties is a rule of equity.”
    
    - _Bank of Cali v. Super. Ct of San Fran_ (1940, cali sup ct)
        
        - Joinder can be outweighed by fairness/convenience/practicability
            
        - 19(b) effectively: are the nonjoined person’s interests separable from the parties’?
            
    - From _Giampietro v. Viator_:
        
        - Check necessary under 19(a), and if not, deny motion.
            
        - Check if joinder of necessary party would defeat subject-matter jurisdiction. If not, deny motion.
            
        - Check whether indispensable under 19(b). If not, deny motion. If so, grant motion.
            
    - _Provident Tradesmens Bank v. Patterson_ (1968, Harlan)
        
        - Four ACTUAL interests of 19(b):
            
            - P’s interest in having a forum, whether alternative exists
                
            - D’s interest in avoiding multiple litigation/inconsistent relief/sole responsibility for shared liability
                
            - Interest of outsider
                
            - Interest of the courts and public in complete+consistent+efficient resolution

        - Intervention of right elements: timely motion, interest, impairment, adequacy
            
        - such a low standard for meeting each
            
    - Permissive intervention elements: timely motion, common question of law or fact, consider whether intervention will unduly delay or prejudice adjudication

## Discovery

- “Typically, the Constitution does not affect discovery requests.”
    
    - Balance the movant’s need for the info and inability to get it by other means v the nonmovant’s interest in that info remaining undisclosed
        
    - _Schlagenhauf v. Holder_ (1964, Goldberg)
        
        - Discovery requests cannot be struck for 1st amdmt reasons
            
        - Orders must only be as broad as necessary
            
    - _Seattle Times v. Rhinehart_ (1984, Powell): No protective order without ensuring that it furthers an important or substantial interest unrelated to suppressing expression, and that limitation of 1st amendment freedoms is no greater than necessary to promote that interest
        
    - P: _The Boyd Grp. v. D’Orazio_: “generalized, unsubstantiated, speculative fear” is not good cause for a discovery order
        
- “Privileged materials are exempt from discovery.”
    
    - _Hickman v. Taylor_ (1947, Murphy): prepared in advance of litigation (ordinary)? Must show substantial need and inability to obtain from other sources. Reflects the mental impressions of the attorney (opinion)? Never disclose.
        
        - Policy: attorneys make bad witnesses, should be able to create their case in a zone of privacy, should not be able to live off borrowed wits
            
    - _Upjohn v. U.S._ (1981, Rehnquist)
        
        - attorney-client privilege is a case-by-case privilege that encourages both lawyers to give professional advice to their clients, and clients to give good information to their lawyers to make good advice
            
        - Corporate communications are privileged if:
            
            - Doc/comm was provided by agents of corporate client to counsel in counsel’s capacity at direction of agents’ superiors
                
            - Information necessary for obtaining legal advice
                
            - Agents were aware that communication was for obtaining legal advice
                
            - Communication treated as confidential
                
    - Exceptions to atty-client privilege:
        
        - Facts
            
        - Crime/fraud
            
        - Voluntary disclosures by client to non-attorneys or non-clients
            
    - Exceptions to work-product immunity:
        
        - Facts
            
        - Crime/fraud
            
        - Voluntary disclosures by attorney
            
        - Ordinary course of business exception (anything not in anticipation of litigation)
            
        - A party’s statement
            
- Related procedure
    
    - RCP 26: discovery
        
    - RCP 30: oral depo

    - RCP 37: discovery sanctions
        

## Judgment as a Matter of Law

- For all of these, resolve all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant’s favor
    
- “Summary judgment is not a procedural shortcut, but a rule of judicial efficiency that prevents a wasteful or pointless trial.”
    
    - _Lundeen v. Cordner_ (1966, 8th cir): if trial would not give an opportunity for counsel to examine/cross-examine a key witness, what’s the point? No facts could be contested.
        
    - _Cross v. US_ (1964, 2d cir)
        
        - what will conform to a statute/precedent is a fact issue
            
        - Even though counsel did not cross-examine witness in depo, could still cross-examine at trial
            
        - Credibility of a witness is a fact issue
            
    - P: _Adickes_ _v. Kress_ (1970): party opposing sumju has burden of responding only after movant meets burden to come forward with proof of no genuine fact issue
        
    - The Celotex Trilogy
        
        - _Celotex Corp v. Catrett_ (1986, Rehnquist):
            
            - Rehnquist: when nonmovant bears burden of proof, the summary judgment motion can rely solely on the pleadings (nobody does this though)
                
            - Brennan: if nonmovant has burden of proof, all movant has to do is negate or show that nonmovant had insufficient evidence. If movant has burden, will need to show specific facts that prove the case.
                
        - N: _Anderson v. Liberty Lobby_ (1986): if claim has higher standard of proof like libel, higher sumju standard
            
        - N: _Matsushita Electric Industrial v. Zenith Radio Corp._ (1986): in antitrust, granting sumju used to be absurd (thousands of documents, must be a fact issue somewhere), now it follows _Anderson_
            
    - _Scott v. Harris_ (2007, Scalia): if there is such overpowering evidence for an element that no reasonable jury could find otherwise, can grant sumju
        
- “If no reasonable jury could find for a party after their case has been fully heard, the court may grant a motion for directed verdict against their claim.”
    
    - MUST FILE THIS if you want JNOV
        
    - _Galloway v. US_ (1943, Rutledge): an inference directly on whether the burden of proof has been met is not a reasonable inference for the purposes of a directed verdict
        
- “JNOV has certain alternatives that are not as potent as a reversal of the judgment.”
    
    - _Neely v. Martin K. Eby Construction_ (1967, White): Rule 50 does allow reversal on appeal from a jnov by its plain language and interpretation
        
    - When losing party moves for JNOV or alternatively new trial and both are denied, winning party should preserve right to assert that the proper remedy in the event of error is a new trial

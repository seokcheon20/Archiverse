In the interest of public access to knowledge, I will be uploading all of my outlines from law school classes I've taken to this website in downloadable file and webpage format. An outline is the condensed sum content of a legal course's casebook readings and class discussion in the format that will be most useful for either studying for an exam or for quick reference during that exam.

Feel free to use these for your own understanding of a doctrine or as a starting point for further research.
## Caveats
These are **not legal advice**, and **not a professional opinion**; nor are they the complete picture of any area of the law. If the professor thought it was important, it was in here; thus it's not even my own complete understanding of the law.

If you're a law student, making your own outline will make studying exponentially easier and you *will* score higher. Your professor cares about different things than mine.

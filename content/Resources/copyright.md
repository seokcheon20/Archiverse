The field is notoriously paywalled (the field is also [[Essays/law-school|broken]]), but I'll try to link to publicly available versions of my sources whenever possible. The content of this entry is my interpretation, and is not legal advice or a professional opinion. Whether a case is binding on you personally doesn't weigh in on whether its holding is the nationally accepted view.

The core tenet of copyright is that it protects original expression, which the Constitution authorizes regulation of as "works of authorship." This means **you can't copyright facts**. It also results in two logical ends of the spectrum of arguments made by plaintiffs (seeking protection) and defendants (arguing that enforcement is unnecessary in their case). For example, you can't be sued for using the formula you read in a math textbook, but if you scan that math textbook into a PDF, you might be found liable for infringement because your reproduction contains the way the author wrote and arranged the words and formulas on the page.

## Housekeeping
Happy holidays! Dropbox has begun opting their customers in by default to allowing the company to train AI on your stored documents in the cloud. I feel validated in my [[Projects/Obsidian/livesync|Obsidian LiveSync]] goals.

Literally the second I finished finals I started attacking the essays I have unpublished. Expect one released soon, Iâ€™ll parade it about my mastodon as well. 
## Pages
- The aforementioned unpublished essays are being worked on. Primarily the law school one, which I want to have out as soon as possible.
- Oops, [[Programs I Like/hundred-rabbits|Hundred Rabbits]] isn't a seedling anymore.
- Updated [[Projects/my-computer|My Computer]], and extracted some definitions for the misc subdirectory.
## Status Updates
- Small tweaks to the comment system and moderation. 
- Explorer entries now list "Home" pages at the top of each subfolder.
- Clarified privacy policy.
- Changing favicon and static images, may need a few weeks to update on your side.

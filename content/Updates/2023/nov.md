## Housekeeping
It's birthday month! My hosting service is surprising me with random shutoffs for "inactivity", despite the fact that this webpage serves so much bot traffic (all blocked, of course) and I have about seven other microservices that I use daily being called from the same webserver.

Not much progress on the more lengthy articles since I'm currently in term paper hell and have to use my words per minute elsewhere.
## Pages
- Added a reference to how I block bots on this website: [[Projects/Obsidian/digital-garden|Digital Garden]]
- Updated [[Projects/Obsidian/quartz-comments|Remark42 Comments]], check [[#Status Updates]] for more info
- Added page on [[Programs I Like/functional-programming|functional programming]], I'll rant about Monads and Arrows some other time
- Updated the [[Programs I Like/hundred-rabbits|Hundred Rabbits Ecosystem]] (here's their [Nov Update](https://100r.co/site/log.html#nov2023))
## Status Updates
- Finally created a Mastodon account! <a rel=“me” href=“https://social.treehouse.systems/@be_far”>@be_far@treehouse.systems</a> go follow me.
- Got email working for comments!! Go check it out and use the fancy new sign in.

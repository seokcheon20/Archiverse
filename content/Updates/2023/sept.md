## Housekeeping
Happy spooky season! I'm going to start tracking lists of changes that happen during the previous month. This should provide a nice little bump to the RSS feed since I edit pages post-creation a lot.

There'll also be a small blog component to it.
- I'm proud to announce that the title of this garden is now Projects & Privacy! Originally, I worried about putting a privacy focus on here, but then I realized that privacy was a significant part of almost all of my projects and everything [[Projects/my-cloud|that I host]].
- Law school is back in full swing! I'm juggling a lot of computer projects as well as coursework, so this site might slow a bit.
- I did a vegan cheese party with some friends (they're vegan, not me) and made a cheese platter, margherita pizza, and some fried mozz sticks. Here's the result:

## Pages
- I added comments with Remark42, and documented it [[Projects/Obsidian/quartz-comments|here]].
- Finished [[Programs I Like/code-editors|Code Editors]].
- I fiddled with the [[Garden/index|homepage]] a bit.
- I started fleshing out [[Projects/my-computer|My Computer]].
- More content [[Essays/on-linux|on Linux]]!
- I'm researching and angling to fully write through the essay on [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]].
- I'm working towards writing an essay on law school and its problems as an institution. Nothing to report yet.
- I've refactored some things to come more into alignment with how a digital garden normally looks, including using #seedling as a tag. My goal is to get this site on its feet with a better theme and a few substantial essays and then submit it to the Quartz Showcase for some publicity. I'll also plug it on Mastodon if I ever set up an account there.
## Status Updates
- I finally got around to looking into Mastodon and the Fediverse more broadly. The ideas are *insanely* cool. Expect pages and maybe projects on it in future.
- I swapped from a custom compiled Zen kernel to the CachyOS-Bore-EEVDF kernel available in the Copr repos, and holy crap, the performance is night and day. All of the options in games that would lock my CPU-bound eGPU setup to less than 60 frames are now open to me, and graphical fidelity is better than ever.

See you in October!

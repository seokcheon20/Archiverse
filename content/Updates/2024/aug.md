## Housekeeping
I've now been maintaining this garden for a year! My productivity on it has not been what I've wanted it to be, but I can confidently say that working on this website does indeed help me with what I've outlined in [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]].

In completely unrelated news, (*Tom Scott Voice*) I am in Australia (*end Tom Scott Voice*) until the end of 2024, again with a light schedule. Let's see how that pans out for this site and my open source contributions.
## Pages
- New: [[Projects/latex|A Working Latex Install that Doesn't Suck]]
- Content update: [[Essays/no-ai-fraud-act|No AI FRAUD Act]]. Since the relevance of this act has mostly passed (trends are back on the NO FAKES final draft), I'm considering breaking the essay into atomic pieces in the Resources folder so that it's more of a helpful reference than a comprehensive argumentative piece. Even though `Dict/` is normally where I put atomic files, that directory is for epistemologically neutral information which this essay is not.
- Content update: [[Essays/on-linux|The Linux Experience]]
- Content update: [[Projects/my-computer|My Computer]]
- Okay, for real this time, only two sections left on ai-infringement.
## Status Updates
- Toyed with the light mode color scheme to make it a bit more consistently readable across brightnesses.
- Updated the index again.
- **RSS feeds now display full rich content!** Any bugs, let me know.
	- To fix their ordering, I also played around with date displays. If a file doesn't have the proper date frontmatter, it won't shoot to the front wildly anymore, haha.
- Fixed ~~**Site bug:** Sorry! The Graph View on the right sidebar for desktop readers has a bug if you swap from light to dark mode or vice versa without refreshing the page.~~

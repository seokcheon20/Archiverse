This is being talked about nowhere, but I think it deserves publicity. A New Hampshire cafe that had its Instagram account deleted just won a breach-of-contract action against Facebook over their Section 230 defense! [Seacoast Online coverage](https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/2024/01/26/teatotaller-cafe-owner-wins-instagram-case-nh-supreme-court/72345276007/)

Neat coincidence that Section 230 features quite heavily in one of my newest essays. Happy 2024, all. 
## Housekeeping
I went snowboarding with some law school buddies early this month! Had a great time through the whole trip, but I feel like as soon as I got back there was an onslaught of bad tech policy in the news, haha.

On the bright side, I feel like I finally have a handle on the feel of this site. Front page looks very polished now, and I got around to drawing a great-looking and really symbolic logo:
![[Attachments/logo.png|500]]

It's a moon due to my goals for the site and digital gardening as a whole, and progressively more detailed to reflect the incremental, learn-in-public philosophy of gardening. Hopefully that second meaning is apparent by the 1/2 in the middle of it.
## Pages
- Published [[Essays/law-school|Law School is Broken]]!
- **AI infringement essay about 40% done** with plans to edit in the future. It's a long one.
- Finally have a [[Essays/no-ai-fraud-act|response to poor journalism on the No AI FRAUD Act]] out, highly recommend giving it a read!
- Getting a little sick of seeing arguments across the internet advocating for plagiarism and not citing your sources. Here's [[Essays/plagiarism|my response to plagiarists]]. It's being updated in tandem with the AI essay I'm writing.
- Adding a misc page explaining an interesting legal concept, because I was bored of writing the AI infringement article. Approx 50% done writing it.
- Added my [[bookmarks|public bookmarks]] in the spirit of digital gardening.
- Cleaned up [[Essays/why-i-garden|Why I Garden]] a little bit.
## Status Updates
- Updated the theme a little bit to be easier on the eyes.
	- Not to mention my slick little background cover image...
- Made the index page beautiful and minimal by moving content around.

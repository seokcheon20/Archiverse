## Housekeeping
At some point this decade, I'd like to stop living through major historical events, please.
## Pages
- Fixes, content update: [[Essays/no-ai-fraud-act|No AI FRAUD Act]]
- New: [[Projects/legal-practice-automation|Automation and the Law]]
- Content update: [[Essays/plagiarism|Plagiarism]]
- Precisely **one** main section and **one** subsection left in the AI infringement page before it's ready for edits and publication!
## Status Updates
- Migrated some Misc articles to the new folder [Dict](/Dict), where I'll be shoving any one-liner definitional files from now on. Some will be longer than others, but if I'm just defining a word/phrase or the tech behind it from a neutral standpoint, it will go in there.
- Split formerly Linux-isms into multiple files in Dict.

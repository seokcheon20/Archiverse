## Housekeeping
Hi! Apologies for the lack of content in April. I started working on content for this site again mid-May, and intend to do so at my regular pace for the entirety of summer. I'm unsure whether I'll also be contributing to open source projects in that time.

Microsoft's Recall feature has released, and it's a security mess. Not fun.
## Pages
- New: [[Projects/nvidia-linux|NVIDIA on Linux]]
- New: [[todo-list|Public Todos]]; I moved my todo list out of my personal notes to give an idea of what's next.
- Content update: [[Resources/learning-linux|Learning Linux]]. Expect this to grow pretty substantially.
- Content update: [[Essays/on-linux#The Linux Experience]]. I swapped to a new system!
## Status Updates
- Changed the header font to Monaspace Neon. I really like the [Monaspace](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace) family, available in nerd font as [Monaspice](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

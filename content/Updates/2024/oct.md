## Housekeeping
Happy spooky season!

As of posting this, I've been on the fediverse/socialweb for almost a year. The amount of computer interested folks on there is just amazing for community and troubleshooting. It's not without severe problems by way of moderation and groups platforming abusers, but on an instance with superb moderation, you'll see much less of it. I can't applaud the quality of [Treehouse](https://social.treehouse.systems) 's moderation enough; our instance admin has decades of experience dating back to IRC and makes the experience so much nicer.

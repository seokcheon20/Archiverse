I’m an enthusiast for all things DIY. Hardware or software, if there’s a project to be had I will travel far down the rabbit hole to see it completed. 

I can be reached in the comments here or on Mastodon (<a rel="me" href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@be_far">@be_far</a>), or on Matrix at @be_far:envs.net. 
## By Day
I'm a law student aiming to practice in intellectual property litigation. At a high level, this sort of work primarily involves pointing a lot of fingers and trying to force money to change hands. I enjoy the lower levels the most, where attorneys can really sink their teeth into the kind of technical issues that fascinate me.
## By Night
I obsess over minimizing my digital footprint with respect to services where the users are viewed as the product. The projects within this website are a testament to that fact.

I enjoy rock climbing, building & flying FPV drones, reading, and baking. Hobby electronics repair was previously one of my interests, but modern devices are unfortunately no longer repairable to the extent that I’m able to do so.

I can be found in your local cafe, sipping caffeine that's more dessert than coffee, and typing furiously into a legal document or class outline. If I'm procrastinating, I'll probably be debugging some selfhost service or writing a toy program in Haskell.

Languages I know (in rough order):
- Java
- Python
- C/C++
- Lua
- Ada
- C#
- OSL
- JS/**TS**

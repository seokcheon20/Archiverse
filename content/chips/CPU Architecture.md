Example microarchitecture: Nehalem in 2008

> [!web]- Perplexity
> Key Features of Nehalem Microarchitecture
> 
> 1. Integrated Memory Controller
> The memory controller was moved onto the CPU die, eliminating the need for the traditional Front-Side Bus (FSB) to access memory.
> 
> This integration reduced latency and significantly increased memory bandwidth, with support for DDR3 memory at up to 31.992 GB/s per chip.
> 
> 2. QuickPath Interconnect (QPI)
> QPI replaced the FSB with a high-speed, point-to-point interconnect for communication between CPUs and other components.
> 
> Each QPI link provided up to 25.6 GB/s bidirectional bandwidth, enabling efficient multi-socket configurations and improving scalability.
> 
> 3. Modular Design
> Nehalem was designed as a modular architecture with two main components:
> 
> Core: Houses execution units, L1/L2 caches, and logic for instruction execution.
> 
> Un-Core: Includes shared L3 cache, memory controllers, and I/O logic, allowing scalability for different market segments (e.g., laptops to servers).
> 
> 4. Hyper-Threading Technology
> Reintroduced in Nehalem, Hyper-Threading allowed each core to execute two threads simultaneously, improving multi-threaded application performance.
> 
> 5. Turbo Boost Technology
> Turbo Boost dynamically increased the clock speed of active cores when thermal and power conditions allowed, enhancing single-threaded performance.
> 
> 6. Improved Pipeline
> Nehalem featured a four-wide superscalar pipeline with extensive branch prediction and speculative execution capabilities.
> 
> The pipeline length was 16 stages (two cycles longer than its predecessor), balancing performance and power efficiency.
> 
> 7. Shared L3 Cache
> A large shared L3 cache improved data sharing between cores and reduced latency for frequently accessed data.
> 
> 8. Support for SIMD Instructions
> Nehalem expanded support for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions like SSE4.2, accelerating workloads such as multimedia processing and scientific computing.
> 
> Performance Improvements
> 
> Nehalem delivered significant gains in both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance compared to earlier architectures like Penryn.
> 
> Its modular design allowed it to scale from dual-core laptop processors to high-core-count server processors (e.g., Nehalem-EX).

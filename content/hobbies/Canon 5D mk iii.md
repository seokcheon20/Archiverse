Trusty dusty camera! 

## Lenses

Buy some new lenses: [[Canon camera lens classifications]]. 

I own:

- [EF 50mm f/1.8 STM](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/ef-50mm-f-1-8-stm?type=New&srsltid=AfmBOorKkgTBCDuMqe_5MxQdOmpRbqORz1dUKnf0i0SWVOsrlYoH9LmW) SKU: 0570C002
- [EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/ef-75-300mm-f-4-5-6-iii?color=Black&type=New) SKU: 6473A003
- [20mm F1.4 DG DN | Sigma](https://www.sigma-global.com/en/lenses/a022_20_14/) (thank you ðŸ¥°) 

I have tried out:

- [EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/ef-24-70mm-f-2-8l-ii-usm) SKU: 5175B002

In the year 2024 and onward I would honestly recommend that people get a mirrorless camera... dlsr is toooo heavy... too bulky... mirrorless is the way for sure...

Thank you Sid Meier! Thank you POTATO MCWHISKEY! ðŸ¥”I think civ is a great game series that surprisingly has taught me a lot of random world history trivia.

# How I describe it to someone who hasn't heard of it

Civilization is like Catan but as a video game, so it's Catan on steroids because of all the fun things you can do with a game made digital. I've never played Catan so that could be wildly inaccurate, but Civ is a 4-eX strategy game, where the eX's stand for:

- eXploration, 
- eXpansion, 
- eXploitation,
- eXtermination

## You should play too!

The game goes on sale multiple times a year: [Price history by steamdb](https://steamdb.info/app/289070/) 

(All currency values in USD here) You can get the base game for \$3, and then all the expansions will be on sale for \$5. So \$8 for hundreds of hours of gameplay, maybe even thousands, is honestly a steal!

# Gameplay tips
## Amenities
- Increase this in the early game by having more unique copies of luxuries worked
	- Sell extras to the AI
- In the later game, choose cities with good overlap and then you can put some high-value entertainment complexes. Turns out city overlap is a good thing, actually. 
- More amenities -> happier cities -> more productive by some %

## The best starting tiles
- PLAINS HILLS!! 2 production 2 food after you settle
- On top of a luxury, which gives the luxury automatically instead of needing to research it
- Apparently settlers have higher sight range than warriors, if that helps with thinking about scouting
- Try to get a city down within 2-3 turns at MOST

## Food & housing in cities
- each population requires 2 food. and you need 2 spare housing for normal growth rate. otherwise your excess food is useless.
- Growth > production when you first found a city. So it's always good to focus food, get a monument.

## Religion and Pantheon
- Pantheon comes around 20-25 faith? So you have to plug in the card for +1 faith in the early game if you don't have a tile for it. 
- For religion, the AI likes to take Feed the World asap so the player probably won't get it. Maybe also work ethic? Choral music?

## Victory types
- Culture - win a total # of tourists OVER other civilizations
- Religion - make all other civs' majority religion become your civ's founded religion
- Domination - destroy all the other civs?
- Science - complete all the space race projects
- Diplomatic - only in the expansions. Win 20 victory points in a [variety of ways](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_(Civ6)#Diplomacy) 

## Modding

Go into the steam workshop and add some nice ones. For some of them, I'm amazed that they're not already in the game, but I guess that would have introduced a lot of visual clutter if you don't know what's going on. I did NOT understand how to fix housing or amenities until I got the mods though. 

Types of mods commonly seen:

- UI - just quality of life. e.g. a city-states screen that shows the quests without needing to hover.
- Gameplay - something that changes basic mechanics. e.g. add a builder free to each new city
- New civ or wonder or unit or etc. 

## City-States

Pay attention to the Suzerain special bonus! Some of them are actually quite cool, like the Lahore with their special unit. Others are more useless, e.g. if you got the one that gives gold for international trade routes, but you're playing as Japan...

## Barbarians

They have spotted you if you see a little red exclamation mark over the head, especially scouts. Then they go back to their encampment, and then send a horde of barbarians. Apparently they can't take capital cities but they can be super annoying. 

## Wonders

Are a distraction!

My favorites:

- Petra
- Mausoleum at Halicarnassus

# Specific Civs

## Mongolia - Kublai Khan

[Kublai Khan (Civ6) | Civilization Wiki | Fandom](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Kublai_Khan_(Civ6)) 

Maximize getting trade routes with other civs to get trading posts. Strong strong economy. The special unit travels super far...

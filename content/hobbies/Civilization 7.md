After playing so much [[Civilization 6]], I decided to get the next game! It is extremely confusing...

# Change over time

Official page: [Game Update Notes | Civilization VII](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/) 

## Update 1.1.0 and 1.0.1 patches

# First impressions

The mechanics with army commanders (bringing your whole army along, promotions) and city growth (click to grow, assign resources), are quite refreshing. it's nice to not need builders ðŸ¤£ I was very disoriented by the civ switching during every age. As usual, I haven't won a full game yet, but there are lots of complaints that sometimes the age progresses too fast before you can hit the victory conditions for something. 

## Key differences so far

- Visual: more realistic vibe (my poor 1060...) It looks really good, actually.
- No inspirations/eurekas, instead you can do research/civics twice to unlock extra bonuses

## Features I wish they would add

Or add back!

- Map-wide search
- Lenses that you can view anytime
- Auto-explore on units
- Religion indicators
- Strategic view or something, for lower graphics load and at-a-glance understanding of what's on a tile

### Thoughts on the UI

There's a lot of hate about the UI but overall I think it's fine. It's not like Civ 6 is particularly intuitive, either.

I guess the colors could be improved (more vibrant, color distinction on buildings based on yield) and some of the buttons are comically large. Also, why is the "rest unit" button behind another side-sliding menu?

I learned how to crochet! Thank you to my friend whose name starts with a J. Me and my friend whose name starts with a K learned at the same time, although I borrowed J-friend's yarn and hook. The thing I'm best at making right now is a headphone sprout, although I also learned from youtube videos to make a granny square and a simple flower. I got some brown yarn for myself too. Thank you Joann's the fabric store!

I think it's reasonably easy to learn how to follow a written pattern. It helps a lot more if you follow the YouTube tutorial too. 

It was NOT easy to try following a diagram pattern - I kept forgetting where I was... lol...

## Crochet terms glossary

American terms are what I'm used to, I think. 

- sc - single crochet
- dc - double crochet --> loop twice and bring the yarn through each 
- tc - triple 
- hdc - half double crochet --> loop twice and bring the yarn through both at the same time
- sl st - slip stitch (also used for foundation chains)
- sk 3 - skip 3
- ch st - chain stitch

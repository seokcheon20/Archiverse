I'm a big fan of [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/), which is like strava but for weightlifting. It has a bunch of exercises, video diagrams, and a log and workout tracker.

## Rotations, or things to target

It's good to take a few rest days throughout the week too! 

### Push

### Pull

### Legs

### Back

### Chest

### Not really a rotation but Abs

### Cardio options

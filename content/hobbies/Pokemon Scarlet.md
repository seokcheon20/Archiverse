Bring Koraidon home!

3 main paths, and then 1 extra path after. 

- Starfall street
- Victory Road
- the Titan Pokemon thing

After-path: bringing Koraidon home. ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤« Koraidon is a pokemon from the past. Also it's crazy that the professor was dead ğŸ˜¢ I did suspect that the professor was stuck somewhere but I did not think it was like an AI-Sada. The AI-Sada fight is too difficult. ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤«

Fighting the fantastic four was really difficult ğŸ¥²ğŸ¥² I used up so many items.

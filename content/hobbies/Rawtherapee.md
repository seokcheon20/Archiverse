The starting point is pretty good: 

> First, a little background. A raw photo contains a dump of sensor data, which makes up the bulk of the raw file. This sensor data does not look like a pretty image, in fact it does not look like anything - it is "raw" data, ergo the name. It must be "cooked" to look like the image you saw through the viewfinder. Your camera cooks the raw data into a pretty image, which it stores as a JPEG file inside the raw file (yes, even when you're shooting in only "RAW" mode as opposed to "RAW+JPEG" mode). Due to this fundamental fact of the data being "raw", there is no one correct way for a raw photo to look - the way your camera makes it look is not "the right way", nor is it the only way. However, many photographers would like to use the "camera look" as a starting point for further adjustments, and RawTherapee makes this possible.

> When displaying a raw photo in the File Browser which has never been edited in RawTherapee before, the photo's thumbnail is based on the JPEG image embedded inside that raw file -- the exact same image you see when viewing that photo on your camera or in most other software. Once you open that photo in the Editor, RawTherapee creates a new thumbnail based on the actual raw data. Since creating an image from raw data requires "cooking" it, and since you have not manually edited that image yet, RawTherapee uses parameters from the default processing profile for raw photos to process it. From that moment on, the photo's thumbnail is no longer based on the embedded JPEG but on the actual raw data. When you make adjustments to the image in the Editor, the thumbnail is updated to reflect your changes.

> Busted! üí¨ Announcer, Squad Busters

# Season 1
## Recommended gameplay strategies

- If given a supplier ({mavis, greg}) in the beginning of a non-supplies battle mod, get it and go for the supply asap
- get the blue boxes asap for the 2 shoes per box - eliminates the need to get chickens (the boots were part of a balancing update)
- bust another squad in the first minute of the game for good luck üçÄ
- If only obtaining a supplier in the early-middle of the game, get Mavis for the healing. 
## Favorite combinations

- trader + loot goblins or loot pi√±atas
	- Honestly trader might be a top 3 unit for me
- hog rider + shelly
	- Unfortunately hog rider is a non-negotiable... walking is so slow...
- bandit when in any world with the medium-sized skeletons in a group of 3
	- it's just a free gems printer!
	- bandit in dopplegangers mode is also super broken because they become a gems printer

## Least favorite battle mods:

- baby battle
	- too used to the powerups from unit upgrades
	- This got removed in August 2024! Thank goodness
-  [[#How to play doppelgangers battle mod|doppelgangers]]
	- variety builds a good team. seems like barbarian king might be the best in this mode?
	- although one time I had a team of dynamike and someone was trying to squad bust me, and my dynamikes threw 2 attacks and boomed all of them (clumped up, I guess)

## Quirks:

- "brain rot game"
- I keep accidentally calling it brawl stars but I actually couldn't get through the tutorial of that one. Only gets confused bc it's also made by supercell and I have plenty of friends that like that game better. 

## Strategies

### When to deprioritize getting the boots boxes
- golden boots - no point in collecting extra shoes
- turbo - you'll get enough extra shoes anyway
- doppelganger - first check if chickens are an option, then use a fusion to maximize boot output
- spooky world - monsters are too strong so aim for some form of healing (medic, poco, mavis, trader) before approaching too many

### How to play doppelgangers battle mod
- if you need money, get goblins. if you need boots, get chickens.
- periodically switch to some suppliers so you can stock up on money/healing

### Loot goblins
- MUST have traders
- goblins drop every minute. the 1 minute goblins are a lot. saw a crazy strategy where someone camped the center, dropped a super freeze, and then got all the money in the center because the goblins were slowed and in one place. 

## December 2024 update

This is the best update ever. They added 4 game modes instead of just normal gameplay and my favorite is definitely squad league, where you can pick the your team comp. I've gotten some 800+ gem runs on there. The original game mode is now called like Gemstone Rush or something. Also they added a duo queue mode where you collect gems with a partner. Showdown is a 5-man free for all which is pretty cool but kind of stressful. The gui updates are great too, and I like the changes to the awards system. Instead of win streaks, you get 9 taps for a 1st, 8 for 2nd, etc. Also you can just use a multiplier when you feel like it, so I've gotten 12x4 of some commons. 

## Squad league ideal comp

Must have:

- A supplier (I like greg over mavis)
- Hog rider
- Trader
- Bea (I love Bea, plus I have the Bee Bea skin)
- Archer queen - prefer ranged over melee tbh

I prefer to skip:

- Dynamike - too squishy, not enough damage output
- Chicken - I'll get boots elsewhere
- Dr. T - the minion he spawns is so useless I'm sorry

## Pre- update 2

There's this monster invasion in the whole world. new music, a community update by paula, and an animatic with paula as the wizard. they took out barbarian king/queen from the game for a week or so. they also took out mortis. 

New game modes:

- Ice spirit invasion - my favorite, especially when you drop a bomb
- Whack a mole
- Wild forest
- giant versions of the evil zombie king and dinosaur

New game modes, pt2:

- gem dash - rings and goblins
- gem something else: pot of gems and another thing (I did not like this one)

# Season 2

The video is premiering soon - looks like something about "Heroes"?

## Mid 2025 update - season 2 squad busters

Huge gameplay update hit squad busters in May 2025. Pre-update, gameplay was getting pretty stale. I had my lineup pretty solid, each game was approximately the same, not much progression left.

Upgrade progress pre-update:

  New update: your squad centers around having a hero. At update time, you choose either archer queen or barbarian king. The squad now has 3 abilities: 1 from the hero, and 2 from the squad and squaddie upgrades. Hero points upgrade the hero and buy extra squaddies, e.g. 500 Colt. Upgrade paths for squaddies are slower, instead of 10 10 10 it goes 30, 15, 6, 3. Earning gold is also a lot slower, and you can buy Barbarian King and Royale King with gold (150,000). I got Mortis from a pinata duo event. I think there needs to be a bit of balancing - all the people I've seen on Mortis are a lot stronger. Maybe it's inherently part of the ability Mortis has? It's like extra meat shields. 

  Your squad is only 9 units now, and when you buy all the squad members, you can't open chests anymore. I find that in the late game, it's hard to have money to open the chests (50 is a lot!) so I've been taking Greg into battle. If a squaddie dies, you can buy it again at the same upgrade level that you already had. So when you open a chest, the squaddie starts at 1, then the next chest you can choose between 2 squaddies, and the squaddie would upgrade to 2. Then if it dies in between, you can buy it again at level 2. Capiche? Confusing, I know. 

Each squaddie has a new ability. I'll list them out later as before <> after.

| Bo           | Deals more damage to monsters. Attacks a bit slower. Drops a mine when he stops moving. | Approximately the same. The mine is now an ability. |
| Colt         | 4 shots in a row damage                                                                 | Just double the damage                              |

| Elita-1      | Just a strong unit from transformers, very tanky                                        | Starts with an upgrade 2/3.                         |

## Mechanics

- Prince Florian can wear different badges. There are badge challenges. There are also some badges that do gameplay changes, some that do game changes. e.g. a badge that turns things into easy mode is the extra `!` badges. 
- In the beginning there are a lot more characters that you can choose from. I played as yellow toad because I chose the "Random" button and that's what it gave me. 
	- Characters
	- Extra characters that don't take damage from enemies! Kind of like easy mode: Yoshi (in a few colors), Nabbit
- In each level, you can get a wonder seed, and then you can get another seed at the end when you reach the flagpole. Some levels have hidden seeds. At the end of each world, you defeat the castle to get the royal seed, which vanquishes a cloudy thing floating around the center Bowser's ship/castle. 

### Levels

Multiple types: regular, badge challenge, "break time!", poplin shop (standees), search party

- Search party: find 5 peach tokens to unlock the wonder seed
- Battleship: classic side-scrolling boss level. At the end of the level, you need to run down a long corridor to jump down on a switch. 

## Worlds

World 1: kinda forgot. There's an underground section where a level lets you push a pipe to the side, drop in a koopa shell, and farm 1-ups. 

World 2 is Puff Puff Peaks. Clouds and rain. 

World 3: the poplin is like a meditating teacher on the mountaintop training you to be better. each level is a trial. after finishing this world, you can enter worlds 4,5,6 however you want (based on how many wonder seeds of the center region that you get)

World 4: desert. the baby bowser has taken all the water in the area. The return of the wiggler! A lot of hidden levels within the desert (sand, sandstorm, behind curtains).

World 5: Fungi mines. This is where we started using the drill hat! It's very cute to dig into the ceiling. In some of the wonder levels, you can become a slime. 

World 6: Deep magma bog. Lots of layers, lots of levels. there's 2 sets where you can get 15 seeds to progress the story, or get 25 seeds to get to a really difficult castle.

Final world: Bowser's castle! There was a linear series of 4-5 challenge levels. I found each of these quite delightful, even if I ragequit a few times. 

After that, you can do a wiggler race to unlock the secret world. As of 2025-07-29, I'm still stuck on the first level of the secret world because I've been rage quitting. It's a Goomba wonder level and it's so difficult to move around and jump.

Zelda wakes up from a rock, gets a sheika plate, becomes an iPad kid. Talks to an old man, activates a huge tower, and a voice tells Zelda to defeat Goman who is being contained by the Hyrule castle right now. Then the old man says he'll give us his windglider if we defeat a trial temple thing and get the treasure, so we do. Unlocked the magnetism rune power (pretty cool!) and got a spirit orb from the monk thing that set up the trial. There's a goddess named Hylia. There used to be a Sheikah civilization with all this advanced technology. The slate also allows us to fast travel.

Danielewski"), published in March 2000 by [Pantheon Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_Books "Pantheon Books"). A bestseller, it has been translated into a number of languages, and is followed by a companion piece, _[The Whalestoe Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whalestoe_Letters "The Whalestoe Letters")_.

> The novel is written as a work of [epistolary fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistolary_fiction "Epistolary fiction") and [metafiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction "Metafiction") focusing on a fictional [documentary film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film "Documentary film") titled _the Navidson Record_, presented as a [story within a story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_within_a_story "Story within a story") discussed in a handwritten [monograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monograph "Monograph") recovered by the primary narrator, Johnny Truant. The narrative makes heavy use of [multiperspectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiperspectivity "Multiperspectivity") as Truant's [footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footnote "Footnote") chronicle his efforts to transcribe the manuscript, which itself reveals the _Navidson Record_'s supposed narrative through transcriptions and analysis depicting a story of a family who discovers a larger-on-the-inside labyrinth in their house.

# Overall thoughts

2024-06-25

- exciting to read through! was skimming the subreddit but didn't get too many spoilers thankfully
- tracking down the footnotes is difficult sometimes
# Progress reports

## 2024-06-16

Finished chapter 3. Had a lot of fun reading through the first few chapters, although I also flipped through some of the future chapters to get a glimpse of what is upcoming. I think one annoying thing is that the font size for the footnote numbers in the text is so small, so I'm not used to visually looking for what the footnotes are referring to. It's nice to be able to pick up the book and read during some of the dead time throughout the week. 

First impressions of the book - horizontally wider than what I expected. The cover is quite nice. The monospaced font of Johnny Truant confused me a bit at first but after getting to the first chapter it makes sense now. I got a little curious and started looking at some of the content in the subreddit for the book, and tried my best to avoid spoilers. Overall I think it's a fun read and excited to keep going. 

Also Johnny is in LA - kind of fun to connect the locations mentioned to what I remember of the area.

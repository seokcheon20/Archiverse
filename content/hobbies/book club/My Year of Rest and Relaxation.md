[My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh | Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279110-my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation) 

I started this book knowing what it was going to be about. Sad and pitying the awful main character. The doctor made me really angry and I started skipping over the dialogue there. RIP Reva. 

Based on a review I could also read [You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine by Alexandra Kleeman | Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/book/show/23461003.You_Too_Can_Have_a_Body_Like_Mine)

Inspired by Turntrout's [You Should Read “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality”](https://turntrout.com/read-hpmor)  (full disclosure I only skimmed about 1/3 of the blog post).

[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality | Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction.](https://hpmor.com/) This is the citation dun dun dun. [@yudkowsky2016hpmor]

It's really funny! Chapter 5 got me wheezing 🤣 Where's the rationality part?

> I will only ask that you think twice and ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to distrust me. 💬 Chapter 17

Chapter 22 is delightful! Harry going through the science and the experimental design in two aspects for testing magic. 

Chapter 23 has a DnD reference!

Some chapter somewhere where Harry tells Draco to learn to question the known order of things. Once you become a scientist/rationalist, there's no going back.

I got tired at some point and started reading some critical reviews of HPMOR: [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality review by su3su2u1](https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/) was pretty funny to read.

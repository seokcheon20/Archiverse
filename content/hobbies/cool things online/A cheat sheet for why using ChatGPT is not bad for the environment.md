[My post on why ChatGPT is not bad for the environment](https://andymasley.substack.com/p/individual-ai-use-is-not-bad-for) got a lot of readers. It ended up around 9000 words, which is a lot to drop on someone who wants to learn more about the topic. This post will be a cheat sheet for that post, framed around conversations you might have about AI chatbots and the environment. I add a lot of new arguments and intuitions for interpreting the data, but all the factual claims are already made in the last post. I’ve broken it up so you can skip around and only read sections relevant or interesting to you.

This (and my other) post is about why it’s not bad for the environment if you or any number of people use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Claude](http://claude.ai/), or other [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLMs). You can use ChatGPT as much as you like without worrying that you’re doing any harm to the planet. Worrying about your personal use of ChatGPT is wasted time that you could spend on the serious problems of climate change instead.

This post is not about the broader climate impacts of AI beyond chatbots, or about whether AI is bad for other reasons ([copyright](https://www.masslawblog.com/copyright/copyright-and-the-mechanics-of-large-language-models/), [hallucinations](https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/llm-hallucination/), [job loss](https://intelligence-curse.ai/), [risks from advanced AI](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/), etc.).

This post will only focus on the arguments, not how I got the numbers. I pull a lot of data and graphs from my last post. To see how I got those, just read that.

We can divide concerns about ChatGPT’s environmental impact into two categories:

- **Personal use:** How much ChatGPT increases your personal environmental footprint.
    
- **Global use:** How much ChatGPT is harming the planet as a whole.

I’ll write a bunch of responses to the most common objections in each category, this time much simpler and pared down so you can use them IRL.

Throughout this post I’ll assume ChatGPT uses 3 Watt-hours (Wh) of energy, which is 10x as much as a Google search. This statistic is likely wrong. [ChatGPT’s energy use is probably lower](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use), but [Google’s might be lower too](https://engineeringprompts.substack.com/p/does-chatgpt-use-10x-more-energy), or maybe higher now that they’re incorporating AI into every search. We’re a little in the dark on this, but we can set a reasonable range. It’s hard for me to find a statistic that implies ChatGPT uses more than 10x as much energy as Google, so I’ll stick with this as an upper bound to be charitable to ChatGPT’s critics.

[Image generators also use 3 Wh per prompt](https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption), so everything I say here also applies to AI images.

ChatGPT uses 3 Wh. This is enough energy to:

- Leave a single incandescent light bulb on for 3 minutes.
    
- Leave a wireless router on for 30 minutes.
    
- Play a gaming console for 1 minute.
    
- Run a vacuum cleaner for 10 seconds.
    
- Run a microwave for 10 seconds
    
- Run a toaster for 8 seconds
    
- Brew coffee for 10 seconds
    
- Use a laptop for 3 minutes. ChatGPT could write this post using less energy than it takes you to read it.

You can look up how much 3 Wh costs in your area. [In DC where I live it’s $0.00051](https://www.energysage.com/local-data/electricity-cost/dc/#:~:text=solar%20for%20instance.-,Electric%20rates%20in%20Washington%20D.C.,rate%20of%2020%20%C2%A2/kWh.). Think about how much your energy bill would have to increase before you noticed “Oh I’m using more energy. I should really try to reduce it for the sake of the climate.” What multiple of $0.00051 would that happen at? That can tell you roughly how many ChatGPT searches it’s okay for you to do.

Because this is so low, encouraging people to stop using ChatGPT is basically never going to have any impact on their individual emissions. If individual emissions are what you’re worried about, ChatGPT is hopeless as a way of lowering them. It’s like seeing people who are spending too much money, and saying they should buy one fewer gum ball per month:

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_1.jpg]]

By being vegan, I have as much climate impact as not prompting ChatGPT 400,000 times each year (the water impact is even bigger). I don’t think I’m going to come close to prompting ChatGPT 400,000 times in my life, so each year I effectively stop more than a person’s entire lifetime of ChatGPT searches with a single lifestyle change. If I choose not to take a flight to Europe, I save 3,500,000 ChatGPT searches. this is like stopping more than 7 people from searching ChatGPT for their entire lives. Preventing ChatGPT searches is a hopelessly useless lever for the climate movement to try to pull. We have so many tools at our disposal to make the climate better. Why make everyone feel guilt over something that won’t have any impact?

The average American uses about 10,000 times as much energy each day. If each of these dots is one ChatGPT prompt, all the dots together are how much energy you use in one day.

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_2.jpg]]

I still find, even after showing this, that some people think using literally any additional energy is bad, because “every bit matters.” The thing is that our energy use changes a lot day to day, just like the money we spend changes day to day. If I started spending an additional penny per month, I wouldn’t notice, because there would be other days where I’d randomly spend way more or fewer pennies on other things. If I looked at a graph of my spending, the penny would be drowned out in the random noise of my other decisions. ChatGPT searches are like this. They use so little energy that they get drowned out in the random ways we change our energy use day to day. If you looked at a graph of my energy footprint before and after using ChatGPT, you wouldn’t notice any change at all.

I think a lot of people don’t realize how much water we each use every day.

Almost all electricity generation involves heating water to create steam to spin a turbine. The American energy grid uses [58,000,000,000,000 gallons of water every year](https://www.aau.edu/research-scholarship/featured-research-topics/how-much-water-does-us-energy-system-use#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20the,gallons%20of%20freshwater%20is%20consumed.). That’s enough to cover the entire surface area of Pennsylvania in Olympic swimming pools.

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_3.jpg]]

Wow

In America it takes about [2 gallons of water to produce 1 kWh of electricity](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/33905.pdf). The average American uses around 30 kWh per day, so they use 60 gallons of water per day just to generate their electricity. [They also use around 100 gallons of water directly each day, so 160 gallons in total](https://water.phila.gov/wp-content/uploads/files/home-water-use-ig5.pdf).

When I hear people say “50 ChatGPT searches use a whole bottle of water!” I think they’re internally comparing this to the few times a year they buy a bottle of water. That makes ChatGPT’s water use seem like a lot. They’re not comparing it to the 1200 bottles of water they use every single day in their ordinary lives.

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_4.jpg]]

50 ChatGPT prompts

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_5.jpg]]

Your day in water bottles

Each ChatGPT prompt uses [between 10-25 mL](https://www.govtech.com/question-of-the-day/how-much-water-does-chatgpt-drink-for-every-20-questions-it-answers) of water if you include the water cost of training, the water cost of generating the electricity used, and the water used by the data center to cool the equipment.

This means that every single day, the average American uses enough water for 24,000-61,000 ChatGPT prompts.

Each dot in this image represents one ChatGPT prompt’s worth of water. All the dots together represent how much water you use in one day in your everyday life:

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_6.png]]

If you want to prompt ChatGPT 40 times, you can just stop your shower 1 second early. If you normally take a 5 minute shower, set a timer for 299 seconds instead, and you’ll have saved enough water to justify 40 ChatGPT prompts.

If you want to reduce your water footprint, avoiding ChatGPT will never make a dent.

Everything else we do online uses water in data centers too. ChatGPT seems to have been singled out because it uses a little more water per use than Google, but it doesn’t look bad relative to other normal online things we do.

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_7.jpg]]

If you multiply an extremely small value by 10, it can still be so small that it shouldn’t factor into your decisions.

If you were being billed $0.0005 per month for energy for an activity, and then suddenly it began to cost $0.005 per month, how much would that change your plans?

A [digital clock](https://energyusecalculator.com/electricity_alarmclock.htm) uses one million times more power (1W) than an [analog watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_watch#:~:text=Modern%20mechanical%20watches%20require%20of,which%20served%20to%20regulate%20the) (1µW). “Using a digital clock instead of a watch is one million times as harmful to the climate” is correct, but misleading. The energy digital clocks use rounds to zero compared to travel, food, and heat and air conditioning. Climate guilt about digital clocks would be misplaced.

The relationship between Google and ChatGPT is similar to watches and clocks. One uses more energy than the other, but both round to zero.

When was the last time you heard a climate scientist say we should avoid using Google for the environment? This would sound strange. It would sound strange if I said “Ugh, my friend did over 100 Google searches today. She clearly doesn’t care about the climate.” Google doesn’t add to our energy budget at all. Assuming a Google search uses 0.3 Wh, [it would take 30,000 Google searches to increase your monthly energy use by 1%](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20average%20annual,6%2C178%20kWh%20per%20residential%20customer). People who care about the climate freaking out about how often they Google would be a sad meaningless distraction. Imagine what your reaction would have been to someone telling you they did ten Google searches. You should have the same reaction to someone telling you they prompted ChatGPT.

What matters for your individual carbon budget is total emissions. Increasing the emissions of a specific activity by 10 times is only bad if that meaningfully contributes to your total emissions. If the original value is extremely small, this doesn’t matter.

It’s as if you were trying to save money and had a few options for where to cut:

- You buy a gum ball once a month for $0.01. Suddenly their price jumps to $0.10 per gum ball.
    
- You have a fancy meal out for $50 once a week to keep up with a friend. The restaurant host likes you because you come so often, so she lowers the price to $40.

It’s very unlikely that spending an additional $0.10 per month is ever going to matter for your budget. Spending any mental energy on the gum ball is going to be a waste of time for your budget, even though its cost was multiplied by 10. The meal out is making a sizable dent in your budget. Even though it decreased in cost, cutting that meal and finding something different to do with your friend is important if you’re trying to save money. What matters is the total money spent and the value you got for it, not how much individual activities increased or decreased relative to some other arbitrary point.

Google and ChatGPT are like the gum ball. If a friend were worried about their finances, but spent any time talking about foregoing a gum ball each month, you would correctly say they had been distracted by a cost that rounds to zero. They should be able to enjoy something that’s very close to free. The same is true for our energy budget. What matters for the climate is the total energy we use, just like what matters for our budget is how much we spend in total. The climate doesn’t react to hyper specific categories of activities, like search or AI prompts. What matters is our total CO2 emissions. If an extremely small slice of your energy budget suddenly jumps up by 10, it is unlikely to affect your overall energy budget.

If you’re an average American, each ChatGPT prompt increases your daily energy use (not including the energy you use in your car) [by 0.01%](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20average%20annual,6%2C178%20kWh%20per%20residential%20customer). It takes about 100 ChatGPT prompts to increase your daily energy use by 1%. If you did 100 ChatGPT prompts in 1 day and feel bad about the increased energy, you could remove an equal amount of energy from your daily use by:

- Running a clothes drier for 6 fewer minutes.
    
- Running an air conditioner for 18 fewer minutes.

There are costs that are just so incredibly small that it does not matter if you take a few more. Imagine that someone told you that they had perfectly timed their microwave down to the second for each meal. They knew that their vegan chicken nuggies needed exactly 3 minutes and 42 seconds. Any longer and they would be wasting energy. That would be admirable, but a very tiny thing that would take a lot of extra effort relative to how much it helps the climate (basically not at all). If someone else just set the microwave to 4 minutes, this would use so little extra energy that it wouldn’t be bad for the climate at all.

This would also be 2 ChatGPT search’s worth of extra energy.

I sometimes hear people say that you should “think carefully about your ChatGPT use” and “be environmentally aware while using it” because of its environmental impact, and not just use it for simple things you could use other services for, like a simple search or a calculator or just making jokes. This sounds a lot like scolding the person setting their microwave to 4 minutes instead of 3:42. It’s misunderstanding just how little energy is involved.

I regularly use the Google search bar as a calculator. I’m too lazy to click on the calculator app on my computer. The search bar is right there. This adds a tiny tiny bit of energy cost, but it’s not enough that I should ever worry.

Suppose you gave yourself an energy budget for goofy ChatGPT prompts. Every year, you’re allowed to use it for 1000 goofy things (a calculator, making funny text, a simple search you could have used Google for). At the end, all those prompts together would have used the same amount of energy as running a single clothes dryer a single time for half an hour. This would increase your energy budget by 0.03%. This is not enough to worry about. If you feel like it, please goof around on ChatGPT.

I think the main way people get tripped up about ChatGPT is that they hear ominous stories about the (very real!) environmental costs of AI, like AI raising energy demand so much that it’s straining the energy grid or causing coal plants to reopen, and assume ChatGPT’s to blame. They hear these stories, look around, and see that everyone’s using ChatGPT, and assume there must be some connection. They think that even if all those previous cited numbers about individual use being small are true, they must still add up to something really bad because of all these bad stories.

The mistake they’re making is simple: ChatGPT and other AI chatbots are extremely, extremely small parts of AI’s energy demand. Even if everyone stopped using all AI chatbots, AI’s energy demand wouldn’t change in a noticeable way at all. The data implies that at most all chatbots are only using 1-3% of the energy used on AI. Meanwhile, 400,000,000 people are using ChatGPT every day and sending 1 billion prompts. If we convinced every one of those people to stop using ChatGPT forever (along with Gemini, Claude, Grok, and other language models), AI energy and water use would still be 97-99% of its current value.

One fun way to build your intuition on this is to compare how many homes a coal plant can power vs. how many homes’ worth of energy ChatGPT is using. Reported energy use implies that [ChatGPT consumes about as much energy as 20,000 American homes](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-uses-17-thousand-times-more-electricity-than-us-household-2024-3). An average US coal plant generates enough energy for [80,000 American homes every day](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=104&t=3). This means that even if OpenAI decided to power every one of its billion ChatGPT queries per day entirely on coal, all those queries together would only need one quarter of a single coal plant. ChatGPT is not the reason coal plants are ropening to power AI data centers.

The services using 97-99% of AI’s energy budget are (roughly in order)

- **Recommender Systems** - Content recommendation engines and personalization models used by streaming platforms, e-commerce sites, social media feeds, and online advertising networks.
    
- **Enterprise Analytics & Predictive AI** - AI used in business and enterprise settings for data analytics, forecasting, and decision support.
    
- **Search & Ad Targeting** - The machine learning algorithms behind web search engines and online advertising networks.
    
- **Computer vision** - AI tasks involving image and video analysis.
    
- **Voice and Audio AI** - AI systems that process spoken language or audio signals.

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_8.jpg]]

It’s true that if everyone used ChatGPT more, the carbon cost would rise by what we’d consider a lot for an individual person.

This is true for everything we do.

Suppose I used this same logic when buying a digital clock.

If everyone in America bought one additional digital clock, we’d need 8000 Olympic swimming pools of water each year to power them. I could say “You individually buying that clock may not matter much, but if you add up what everyone’s doing, it’s a huge impact. We can’t afford an additional 8000 Olympic swimming pools of water!”

The reason this is a bad way to think is that if Activity A uses more of your energy budget than Activity B, then if everyone cut Activity A, that would also have a much bigger impact than everyone cutting Activity B. We still need to focus on cutting the places in our lives that have the most climate impact.

America's energy and water use is made up of everything we individually do in aggregate. If we want to focus on reducing America's energy and water use, the most promising changes are often going to mirror the most promising changes in our daily consumption. If everyone drove one fewer mile, that would be way better than if everyone paused their microwave one second earlier.

If everyone in the world stopped using ChatGPT, this would save around 3GWh per day. If everyone in the world who owns a microwave committed to using their microwaves for 10 fewer seconds every day, this would also save around 3GWh per day.

Imagine you met someone campaigning to convince everyone to decrease their microwave usage by 10 seconds per day. Your first reaction would be “There must be much more effective things to campaign for that would have a lot more climate impact. This must be really small compared to global energy demand.” You’d be correct. Campaigning to stop ChatGPT is exactly like campaigning to use microwaves for 10 fewer seconds.

Global energy consumption in 2023 was around 500,000 GWh per day. That means that ChatGPT’s global 3GWh per day is using 0.0006% of Earth’s energy demand. This is an even smaller proportion than ChatGPT in our personal energy budget.

If one dot represents ChatGPT’s total energy use every day, all the dots together represent the world’s total daily energy use. Imagine that someone came to you and said it was really urgent that a billion people change their behavior and stop using ChatGPT so that we could eliminate exactly one of these dots. How seriously would you take them?

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_9.jpg]]

Climate change is a collective action problem. What we do as individuals does affect the climate in aggregate, so we need a way of deciding what in our lives to focus on changing. We should focus on changing things that will actually matter, like flying less, buying green electricity, changing our diets, and (much more important than the last three combined) working for systematic change in our energy systems to transition to green energy.

This seems big if you don’t consider how many people use ChatGPT. [It’s the most downloaded app in the world](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/chatgpt-became-the-most-downloaded-app-globally-in-march/). Every day [400 million people send 1 billion ChatGPT prompts](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/chatgpt-doubled-its-weekly-active-users-in-under-6-months-thanks-to-new-releases/#:~:text=By%20November%202023%2C%20ChatGPT%20had,was%20driven%20more%20by%20novelty.). The most downloaded app using as much energy as [Barnstable Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstable,_Massachusetts) isn’t surprising. Fortnite uses roughly 400,000 households’ worth of energy. YouTube uses roughly 2,000,000. ChatGPT’s total energy use is small compared to common internet staples.

[Training GPT-4 used 50 GWh of energy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2024/05/23/ai-is-pushing-the-world-towards-an-energy-crisis/). Like the 20,000 households point, this number looks ridiculously large if you don’t consider how many people are using ChatGPT.

Since GPT-4 was trained, it has answered (at minimum) about [200,000,000 prompts per day](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-gemini-usage-surging-rivals-chatgpt-meta-dominating-2025-4) for about 700 days. Dividing 50GWh by the total prompts, this gives us 0.3Wh per prompt. This means that, at most, including the cost of training raises the energy cost per prompt by 10%, from 10 Google searches to 11. Training doesn’t add much to ChatGPT’s energy cost.

A lot of conversations about the climate impact of ChatGPT quickly turn back to its value as a service. “ChatGPT is a plagiarism machine that just produces slop. It’s glorified autocomplete” etc.

I think it’s so important to snap the climate movement out of being distracted by this that you shouldn’t even try to convince people that ChatGPT is useful. That’s too much of a context switch that can get bogged down in minutia. I do think AI is useful ([I explain how I use it here](https://andymasley.substack.com/p/how-i-use-ai)) but that’s a separate point.

The better answer is that even if ChatGPT were completely useless, there are a lot of other useless things we do that use a lot more energy.

Every additional second you spend showering uses enough water for 40 ChatGPT prompts. It’s okay to accidentally go one second over the optimal shower time (or minutes, even!). That’s in some way “useless” because it’s not helping you meet your goal of getting clean, but it’s such a small amount of water that you shouldn’t stress over it.

I have about 40 tiny hanging LED lights in my room:

![[A cheat sheet for why using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment_image_10.jpg]]

Each of these individually is “useless.” If I unscrewed just one of them, I don’t think anyone would notice. Each one of these uses a ChatGPT search’s worth of energy once every 3 hours. Together they’re using as much energy as 13 ChatGPT searches every hour, and using a gallon of water every 12 hours.

My roommates haven’t knocked on my door and said “Sorry Andy, you can’t use those. They’re making the energy bill go up too much” because the lights add about $0.40 to the energy bill each month.

Should I use these even though I don’t need them? They’re just decorative and I could be fine with only a lamp. Even though they use thousands of ChatGPT searches’ worth of energy each month, they don’t contribute to the climate crisis at all, and they make me happy. That should be the end of the argument. People seem to like using ChatGPT. Who cares whether it’s objectively valuable? People like playing Fortnite too. It’s no worse for the environment than my hanging lights. Let them use it if they like. Worry about the things that actually matter.

I’ve been vegan for 10 years, live in a big city with roommates, walk to work every day, and rarely fly. Even though I use ChatGPT daily, my environmental footprint is less than half the average American’s. After all that, it would seem silly for me to feel guilty about either my LED lights or ChatGPT.

You can find things in your life that use similar energy to ChatGPT and make similar comparisons. Sometimes we like to do silly meaningless things that use a tiny amount of energy. If the climate movement wants to make its members feel guilty about that, it will fail.

If you think there are reasons why ChatGPT is not just useless but actively harmful ([copyright](https://www.masslawblog.com/copyright/copyright-and-the-mechanics-of-large-language-models/), [hallucinations](https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/llm-hallucination/), [job loss](https://intelligence-curse.ai/), [risks from advanced AI](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/), etc.) make the case for why it’s harmful clearly. There are a lot of issues I care about that I want people to have more clarity on. I think [the way we treat chickens in factory farms is a massive moral catastrophe](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/). I could add “and each chicken has some environmental cost” every time I talk about it. That would be technically true, but [chickens aren’t especially harmful to the environment](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food), and it dilutes the message I’m actually trying to get across. If you try to smuggle in a lot of extra reasons why something’s bad that are each unconvincing, it can undermine your otherwise strong case. Environmental objections to ChatGPT often dilute other serious criticisms of the technology. Focus and clarity help AI critics’ case.

This one came up a lot in replies to my last post.

I’m not claiming to have discovered anything new in what I post here. I’m just gathering what seems like the consensus on how much environmental impact ChatGPT has, trying to get a bird’s eye view of how it compares to all the other things we do, and coming away with what I think is a pretty strong case that it’s not bad for the environment. Nowhere in my post do I go against the scientific consensus on climate or the environment or AI. You should see this post as basically a long written comment with a lot of links. I’m just some guy who’s noticed that these numbers don’t make sense to worry about if you just compare them to everything else we do.

Energy costs money. AI companies don’t want to give too much energy to you for free. That would be like giving you lots of free money. A ChatGPT subscription costs $20/month. Google search now has an AI chatbot built in and is completely free. If either of these were giving you control over a significant amount of energy, this would basically be a massive free giveaway from the AI companies to billions of people. Why would they want to do that? Where would they get the money for that?

In a lot of these conversations, I have a very strong urge to grab the other person’s shoulders and say “This is 3 Wh of energy we’re talking about!!!! We agree that’s the number! 3 Wh!!!!!! That’s so small!!!! Don’t you know this?!?!?! What happened to the climate movement????? All my climate friends used to know what 3 Wh meant!!! AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!”

This would not be very mature, so instead I post 9000 word blog posts to let off the steam.

It’s hard to get across to people just how strange it is to be standing across from another adult and see them speak so apocalyptically about 3 Wh of energy. [I made this list of other things 3 Wh can do](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDdpPq3MyPdEAoTkho9YABZ0NBEhBH2v4EA98fm3pXQ/edit?usp=sharing).

I have a similar reaction to the 10x a Google search point. When someone says “ChatGPT uses 10x as much energy as a Google search” I’m sometimes tempted to just say “Yes… 10 Google searches.” and just let that hang. Imagine going back to 2020 and saying “Oh man, I thought my buddy cared about the climate, but I just found out he… oh man I can’t bring myself to say it… he searched Google TEN times today.”

When I first started reading about this, I assumed people worried about climate thought that AI was using way more energy than the companies were telling them, but it seems like everyone on both sides of the debate agrees 3 Wh is a reasonable upper bound guess. It’s very strange to have such a strong disagreement about such a clear amount of energy that the climate movement would have never worried about with any previous technology.

All the changes we can make in our personal consumption choices are nothing compared to what we can do if we contribute to making the energy grid green. The current AI debate feels like we’ve forgotten that lesson. After years of progress in addressing systemic issues over personal lifestyle changes, it’s as if everyone suddenly started obsessing over whether the digital clocks in our bedrooms use too much energy and began condemning them as a major problem. It’s sad to see the climate movement get distracted. We have gigantic problems and real enemies to deal with. ChatGPT isn’t one of them.

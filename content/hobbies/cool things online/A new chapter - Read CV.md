Since 2021 we've had the immense privilege of putting our whole selves into building and growing [Read.cv](https://read.cv/). We're tremendously proud of what we've accomplished, and the wonderful community that has blossomed around it.

All of this makes today's update all the more bittersweet to share: **[Read.cv](https://read.cv/) is joining the team at [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/) in their mission to make the world's knowledge more accessible to everyone.**

This was not an easy decision for us, as the start of this new chapter will mark the end of our chapter with [Read.cv](https://read.cv/). With this transition we will begin winding down operations on [Read.cv](https://read.cv/) and [Posts](https://posts.cv/) on January 17th, 2025.

In addition to your professional accomplishments, [Read.cv](https://read.cv/) was our take at celebrating creative work outside of the status quo — digital gardens, independent film, zines, furniture making, self-published music. Today we are making all of your data available to export in hopes that it can inspire our community to carry the torch and build something new.

## What does this mean for Read.cv users?

Our users' data and the transition from the [Read.cv](https://read.cv/) platform is our highest priority. Starting today you can use our simple data export tool (Manage Account > Export Data) to download your profile, writing, sites, messages, and posts.

**January 17th, 2025**

- New user registration, new domain registration, and payments will be stopped.
    
- Data export tools will be available (until May 16th, 2025).

**January 31st, 2025**

- All domains registered via [Read.cv](https://read.cv/) will be migrated to our partners at [hello.cv](https://hello.cv/), where you can continue to manage your DNS, name servers, and renewal.

**February 28th, 2025**

- [Read.cv](https://read.cv/) and [Posts](https://posts.cv/) will switch into read-only mode (until May 16th, 2025).

**May 16th, 2025**

- [Read.cv](https://read.cv/) and [Posts](https://posts.cv/) and all corresponding data will be fully wound down.

Profiles and sites are available as Next.js projects which you can re-host on Vercel or any other platform.

## Read.cv is joining Perplexity

We have spent the last 4 years building [Read.cv](https://read.cv/) as a platform that celebrates your side projects, passions, and curiosity.

We've long admired [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/) and believe great things happen when the world's knowledge is made more open and accessible — like that spark of inspiration when researching a side project or an unexpected rabbit hole catalyzing new ideas.

In that spirit, we are thrilled to be joining the design and engineering team at [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/) to continue in our shared mission of exploration and discovery.

Thank you for your support over the years, and we're excited to show you what we're building soon.

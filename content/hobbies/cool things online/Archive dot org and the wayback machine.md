## What gets archived 
> Anyone with a [free account](https://archive.org/account/signup) can [upload media](https://archive.org/upload/) to the Internet Archive. We work with thousands of partners globally to save copies of their work into special collections.
> 
> Because we are a library, we pay special attention to books. Not everyone has access to a public or academic library with a good collection, so to provide universal access we need to provide digital versions of books. We began a program to digitize books in 2005 and today we scan 4,400 books per day in 20 locations around the world. Books published in or prior to 1928 are available for download, and hundreds of thousands of [modern books can be borrowed](https://openlibrary.org/subjects/in_library#ebooks=true&sort=edition_count) through our [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) site. One of the Internet Archive's missions is to serve people who have difficulty interacting with physical books, so most of our digitized books are available to [people with print disabilities](https://openlibrary.org/subjects/protected_daisy#ebooks=true&sort=edition_count) (learn about access [here](https://archive.org/details/printdisabled&tab=about)).

## Why isn’t the site I’m looking for in the archive?

> Some sites may not be included because the automated crawlers were unaware of their existence at the time of the crawl. It’s also possible that some sites were not archived because they were password protected, blocked by robots.txt, or otherwise inaccessible to our automated systems. Site owners might have also requested that their sites be excluded from the Wayback Machine.

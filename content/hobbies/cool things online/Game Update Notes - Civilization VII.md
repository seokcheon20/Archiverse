# Update 1.2.3 Notes – July 22, 2025

![[Game Update Notes - Civilization VII_image_1.png]]

Hey _Civ_ fans,

Update 1.2.3 is rolling out now! This update is smaller in size, especially following the hefty list of changes from 1.2.2, but it still introduces some meaningful additions: the first round of improvements to Age Transitions, the return of auto-explore, several UI and quality-of-life updates, and a new Commander to join Trung Trac on the battlefield.

**A note for Switch and Switch 2 players**: Update 1.2.3 is now live on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. This includes all free update content; the Right to Rule Collection (Part 1) will arrive at a later date. Thank you Switch players for your patience as we roll this out in stages - we'll share more info soon!

If you caught our last [Dev Check-In](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-jun-10/), you know we're in the middle of some deeper work on systems like Ages, replayability, and how players connect with their civ across history. That work is underway, but it's going to take time. In the meantime, we're continuing to release updates like this one to smooth out rough edges and introduce long-requested features, while we keep pushing on the bigger things behind the scenes.

This update also includes the first half of the new Content Collection, titled Right to Rule* – for many of you, this is part of what you already picked up with _Civilization VII's Founder's Edition_. We'll have the full details below.

And lastly, a few quick notes before you dive in:

- While we aim to maintain backwards compatibility for existing saves as much as possible, some new abilities or effects may not appear until you start a new game or advance to the next Age in your current campaign. For the best experience, we recommend starting a new game, or continuing your current game into the next Age.
- If you encounter any new bugs or issues, try disabling any mods, as some may not yet be compatible with the latest update.
- Are you playing on Steam and want to finish your current save under a previous version? You can do so using our legacy Steam beta branch.

Thank you again to everyone sticking with us, sharing feedback, or just showing up to see what's new in the world of _Civ_. Without further ado, here's what's in Update 1.2.3!

## **Age Transition Improvements**

In our [June 10 Update Check-In](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-jun-10/), we had a section named "The Journey So Far, and What's Ahead." We mentioned there that we had heard feedback from significant segments of our community that we needed to do more work on the abruptness of Age Transitions, improve the overall game replayability (looking especially hard at Legacy Paths), and search for new avenues to allow players to identify more deeply with their empire and its path through history.

Much of that work is ongoing, and though some of the larger changes we have planned will take time, we do have a first round of Age improvements going live with this update, many of which aim to tackle Age Transition abruptness. Here's what's included: 

- **New Continuity Option –** You can now pick the type of Age Transition impact you want, with the new default option called Continuity, and the existing option called Regroup. Here's what you can expect from Continuity:
    - Your Units will stay where they were in the previous Age, but are upgraded to their new version for that Age.
    - Units in other players' borders will be expelled in the same manner as if you lost open borders, but will remain nearby.
    - In addition to what was carried over before, you now can transition with Ships and Siege Units from Antiquity to Exploration, as well as Settlers, Migrants, Scouts, and Merchants in all Ages.
    - You will no longer get Advisor Warnings for large armies.
    - **Please note:** pre-1.2.3 saves will still use the existing Age transition impact, Regroup.

- **Improved Relationship Management –** Instead of sudden shifts to your relationships with other players after Age Transition, your relationships will now slowly be pulled back towards 0 over the course of the game. The further you are away from 0, the faster your relationship will decay. This should feel like a much more natural change to your relationships over time, and encourage you to push some Endeavors here and there to maintain your positive relationships, too. 

- **End of Age Warnings –** We've added a 10- (or more) turn safe zone at the end of each Age that guarantees you can finish your most critical tasks before the transition occurs. This countdown can be extended to 20 turns or turned off completely. No Age progression from any source other than elapsed turns will be added while the countdown is active.

And, some other changes worth noting here: 

- Catapults are now available at the start of the Exploration Age.
- Merchants are now available at the start of the Exploration and Modern Ages.
- Independent Powers will now spawn at the beginning of the Age, after an Age transition.

We'll continue to expand Continuity mode in the future and are already working on other key areas of feedback, including replayability and player identity. Some of the bigger changes will take time, but we hope these updates help your next empire flow more smoothly between Ages. As always, let us know how it feels!

## **Auto-Explore**

It's time: release the Scouts! 

We've mentioned before that Scout Units work a bit differently in _Civ VII_ than _Civ VI_, which is why we wanted players to have the opportunity to play with the Scout's new abilities, instead of adding in auto-explore right away. BUT – we hear you. Sometimes, it's easier to let the Scouts (and Ships) loose and allow them to find a Discovery, encounter a new civ, or even walk straight into danger. 

Here are all the Units that have access to auto-explore:

- **All Ages**: Scout + Unique Variants.
- **Exploration**: Tier 2 and Tier 3 Naval Units (excluding the Cog, which we didn't want to sink from Ocean damage pre-Shipbuilding). 
- **Modern**: All Naval Units except the Submarine.

Here's some auto-explore behavior you should keep in mind: Units will seek to maximize revealed tiles on a move. If they can't reveal any tiles within a single move, they'll try to explore unexplored areas closest to one of your existing Settlements. The Unit will also stop auto-exploring if there is a Discovery within two turns of movement range, or if they move into the Zone of Control of an enemy Unit.

This is just the first implementation of this feature, and as we learned from our Discord feedback event, we have plenty more ideas in mind to expand things down the road. We look forward to making it better over time based on player feedback!

## **New Unique Commander: Trung Nhi**

Our designers have long wanted to give the leader [Trung Trac](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/trung-trac/) a unique Army Commander to represent her legendary sisterhood, and with this update, Trung Nhi joins the battlefield!

Trung Nhi features a unique model, a custom Promotion Tree, and full gameplay functionality. She is granted automatically in the first Age, alongside the first Military Unit produced by a Trung Trac player (including Advanced Starts), and she persists across Ages. As part of this change, Trung Trac no longer grants three free Promotions to her first Commander. She also has a Unique Commendation, "Sisters Unite," which replaces Duty and adds +30 to Heroic Assault.

**Please note**: pre-1.2.3 saves will not receive Trung Nhi! 

**Trung Nhi's Promotion Tree (replaces Leadership):**

- Jungle Warfare: +5 Combat Strength for Units in Tropical terrain within the Command Radius
- Mettle and Courage: +5 Combat Strength for Units in friendly territory within the Command Radius
- Lạc Rebellion: +3 Combat Strength for land Units in the Command Radius when Trung Nhi is adjacent to at least 2 enemies
- One Single Cry: +5 Combat Strength with Coordinated Attack and Focus Fire
- 65 Strongholds: +5 Combat Strength against Fortified Districts within the Command Radius
- Hai Bà Trưng: +15 Combat Strength for this Commander when defending

Try out Trung Nhi by picking Trung Trac as your playable leader! For extra historical flavor for those with the paid content of Right to Rule Collection*, try pairing the Trung sisters with the release of Dai Viet as a DLC civ!

## **New Features**

## End of Age Countdown

- (★ – Community Influenced Item) An end of Age countdown option has been added to the Advanced Start options. The default is 10 turns, but it can be extended to 20 turns or turned off. No Age progression from any source other than elapsed turns will be added while the countdown is active.
    - **Dev Note:** We know it was frustrating for some players when it felt like the end of an Age snuck up on you. We have even more improvements planned for Age Transitions down the line, so let us know how these changes feel!

## Trung Nhi (Unique Army Commander for Trung Trac)

- Trung Nhi joins the battlefield as a new Commander Unit for Trung Trac, with a unique model and unique Promotion Tree that replaces Leadership (please note: pre-1.2.3 saves will not receive Trung Nhi!). The unique Promotion Tree includes: 
    - **Jungle Warfare**: +5 Combat Strength for Units in Tropical in the Command Radius.
    - **Mettle and Courage**: +5 Combat Strength for Units in the Command Radius when in friendly territory.
    - **Lạc Rebellion**: +2 Combat Strength for Land Units in the Command Radius when there are at least 2 adjacent enemies to Trung Nhi.
    - **One Single Cry**: +5 Combat Strength with Coordinated Attack and Focus Fire.
    - **65 Strongholds**: +5 Combat Strength against Fortified Districts for Units in the Command Radius.
    - **Hai Bà Trung**: +15 Combat Strength for this Commander when defending.
- Trung Trac no longer awards 3 free Promotions for her first Commander. This is replaced with Trung Nhi being awarded in the first Age of every game played alongside the first Military Unit produced by the Trung Trac player (Note: Advanced Starts award her as well). 
- Trung Nhi, her abilities, promotions, and appearance persist across subsequent Ages.

## **Gameplay**

**Advisors**

- (★) Made several improvements to Advisor Warnings, including:
    - "Suffering War Weariness" no longer triggers when your opponent is suffering War Weariness.
    - "Nuclear Weapon Available" will no longer appear when the player has a WMD and a Bomber already built.
    - Several warnings no longer occur if you are more than 75% of the way through an Age, including "Surplus Influence," "Over Settlement Cap," and "Overflowing Treasury."

**Age Transitions**

- (★) Added a new Advanced setting allowing players to select their preferred method of Age Transitions: Continuity or Regroup. 
- (★) Catapults are now available at the start of the Exploration Age.
- (★) Merchants are now available at the start of the Exploration and Modern Ages.
- (★) Independent Powers will now spawn at the beginning of the Age, after an Age Transition.

**Diplomacy**

- The effect of Preservation Societies Social Policy can no longer be stacked by repeatedly slotting it in and out of the player's Government.
- Improved relationship management with other leaders, so that relationships will now slowly be pulled back towards 0 over the course of the game, instead of sudden shifts at Age transition. Every five turns your relationship with other players will shift back to neutral by a small amount, and this amount is greater the further your relationship is from neutral. 
    - **Dev Note:** The shift is stronger on the hostile side than the friendly side as there are more ways to hurt a relationship than improve it, and we didn't want to unduly punish players who want to pursue good relationships with their neighbors.

**Environment**

- Ocean Resources are no longer highlighted when using America's Prospector Unique Civilian Unit.

**Economy**

- Lo'i Kalo adjacency bonus is now +1 Culture from adjacent Farms.

- Future Tech/Civics no longer grant Wildcard attribute points, and now give a random attribute point instead.
    - **Dev Note**: These repeatable rewards were causing the overall impact of the attribute system to be greater than intended and started to overshadow your unique leader and civ abilities.
- (★) Maya's Jaguar Slayer and Inca's Chasqui Unique Scout Units now have the "Pet the Dog" ability.
- Heroic Assault Commander ability can no longer target Civilian Units when a Civilian Unit is in the Command Radius during gameplay.

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/62c0vANDd52GSh6Yu2N6b6/7e337c18ce37995c9eded8c81545ecac/CC2_KeyArt_Full.png)

**Right to Rule Collection* – Part One**

The final part of Update 1.2.3 includes something we know many _Founder's Edition_ owners have been waiting for: the first part of the paid Right to Rule DLC*, introducing the new leader Genghis Khan, two new civs Assyria and Dai Viet, and four new Wonders! The second and final part of Right to Rule, currently targeting September 2025, will include the leader Lakshmibai and the civs Silla and Qajar. 

## Leaders

**(Right to Rule DLC*) Added new leader Genghis Khan.**

Born Temüjin, Genghis Khan accomplished a seemingly impossible feat for a man with humble origins – to unite the nomadic Mongol tribes under his singular leadership. His ambitions did not stop with the Mongols, however, and he embarked on campaigns that brought under his control northern China and the eastern portion of the Silk Road. The nature of Genghis Khan's death remains a mystery, unlike his inimical accomplishments.

- **Attributes:** Expansionist, Militaristic
- **Unique Ability - Chosen of Tengri**: +3 Combat Strength to Cavalry units this becomes +5 when in an Army Command Radius. Army Commanders have full movement with zero packed units. Once per Age Army Commanders can use the Convert Independents Action to Convert adjacent Independents Military Units to your Control.
- **Agenda - Tümen:** Increase Relationship by a Medium Amount for having the least Cavalry Units. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount for the leader with the most amount of Cavalry units in an empire.

## Civilizations

Nestled in the Fertile Crescent, Assyria was one of the earliest states to dominate the region. From beginnings in the city of Ashur to the rise of the great Neo-Assyrian Empire, a long succession of kings would oversee the bloody conquest of Babylon, Egypt, and others – acting as a conduit for Mesopotamian culture throughout the lands. These conquests would later spell doom for Assyria, as a Babylonian revolt ended the empire in 609 BCE.

- **Attributes**: Military, Science
- **Unique Ability - Treasures of Nineveh:** Gain a Technology upon capturing a Settlement for the first time. Codices are not awarded from Technologies.
- **Unique Civilian Unit**: Turtanu (Unique Commander Unit)
- **Unique Military Unit**: Magarru (Unique Cavalry Unit)
- **Associated Wonder**: Dur-Sharrukin

**(Right to Rule DLC*)] Added a new Exploration Age civilization Dai Viet.**

Vietnamese history is a dance of resistance and expansion. The medieval Đại Việt kingdom, especially under the Trần Dynasty, stood against Mongol invasions, even as it expanded southward into Cham lands. This dialectic of resistance and conquest led to the creation of a unique Vietnamese culture, one influenced but not dominated by Chinese sources, and a strong sense of identity.

- **Attributes**: Expansionist, Cultural
- **Unique Ability - Hịch Tướng Sĩ:** When you create a Fortification Constructible receive 5 Culture for every urban population in that Settlement. (Scales By Game Speed)
- **Unique Civilian Unit**: Quận Vương (Unique Settler Unit)
- **Unique Military Unit**: Voi Chiến (Unique Ranged Unit)
- **Associated Wonder**: Thanh Hue

## Wonders

**(Right to Rule DLC*) Added four new Wonders:** 

- **Mausoleum at Halicarnassus** – Antiquity
- **Wat Xieng Thong** – Exploration
- **Grand Bazaar** – Exploration
- **Ubudiah Mosque** – Modern

_*Right to Rule Collection is included in the Founders Edition of Civilization VII. It is also available for separate purchase (base game required). Terms apply._

_**The Nintendo Switch version of the game only supports the Tiny, and Small map sizes; it does not support map sizes of Standard and above. For cross-play multiplayer games with players on Nintendo Switch, these map size restrictions will apply._

# Update 1.2.2 – June 23, 2025

Hey _Civ_ fans,

Update 1.2.2 is rolling out now!

**A note for Switch and Switch 2 players**: Update 1.2.2 is now live on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. Thank you for your patience!

We’ve been heads-down at Firaxis putting together a hefty update for you this June, packed with long-awaited features like Large and Huge Maps, expanded Advanced Game Options, and a community favorite: Steam Workshop support. This update also brings new Town Specializations, City-State Bonuses, Beliefs, balance changes, UI improvements, and yes – a very pettable Scout dog.

For more context on what’s in this update, and what’s still being worked on beyond it, check out our recently released [Update Check-In](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-jun-10/).

We’re also trying something new with this update. You’ll notice a [★] icon next to select notes: our way of showing that a feature or change was influenced by the community. If you don’t see this community icon next to something you’ve mentioned, know that it’s not a reflection on your feedback, it’s just a way to highlight some of the broader conversations we’re listening in on. Thanks for being part of the journey, and there’s more to come!

And lastly, a few quick notes before you dive in:

- While we aim to maintain backwards compatibility for existing saves as much as possible, some new abilities or effects may not appear until you start a new game or advance to the next Age in your current campaign. For the best experience, we recommend starting a new game, or continuing your current game into the next Age.
- If you encounter any new bugs or issues, try disabling any mods, as some may not yet be compatible with the latest update.
- Are you playing on Steam and want to finish your current save under a previous version? You can do so using our legacy Steam beta branch.

Read on for the full notes below!

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/3x4i0doyZbu4fAehhZtORt/d77f05594f21879216b6b769333c23fe/Feature_Spotlight_Header.png)

‎

### **Large and Huge Maps**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/7e4Ht9B4QvePK6paBaV78H/0f7c8bbada741219fc27e26c1490b90d/large-map-gif-reduced.gif)

We wanted to take some time to get this feature right, and with 1.2.2, we’re happy to add support for Large and Huge map sizes on all of our map types – for when you really want to explore an epic world. 

Both map sizes default to 10 players, but multiplayer campaigns still max out at 8 total players, including AI and humans. Though 12 total players is still our goal for Huge maps, we need a bit more time to make sure increased player counts won’t compromise game stability or performance.

Because these maps are so large, we’ve added exciting new Pantheons, Religious Beliefs, Discoveries, and City-State bonuses to ensure there’s enough content for all the players in a game. More on those below. 

A quick heads-up that bigger maps have bigger hardware demands.  On some systems, you might notice slower turn times or performance drops, especially on lower-end hardware. Large and Huge map types are supported on PC, Mac, Linux, PS5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch 2.*  Lastly, Balanced starts on Large and Huge maps might encounter map generation oddities. We are actively working on improvements. On these map sizes, we recommend you stick to Standard starts instead of Balanced for the time being. 

_*The Nintendo Switch version of the game only supports the Tiny, and Small map sizes; it does not support map sizes of Standard and above. For cross-play multiplayer games with players on Nintendo Switch, these map size restrictions will apply._

### **New Advanced Game Options**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/76NIafzPB1RG6J1qtYah05/474983b6245e2cc40aac664f91b1ad12/Game_Settings_1920x1080.gif)

One of the best things about _Civilization_ is how many ways there are to play. Some players are happy to peacefully build the biggest, best Cities while others want to ignore all that and go conquer the world ("Yes, your amazing City _does_ look great in my empire"). With 1.2.2, we’ve added several new advanced game setup options to give you even more control over how you play. The below options are currently available only in singleplayer. The new options include:

- Enable or disable specific Legacy Paths per Age (or turn them all off entirely)
- Disable Score Victory (unlimited turns in final Age)
- Enable or disable specific Crises
- Custom AI Difficulty Options (adjust each AI bonus independently)
- Bypass Civ Unlocks on Age Transition (you’ll be able to pick ANY civ from the next Age during an Age transition, no matter what you’ve unlocked through your gameplay decisions)
- Adjust Independent Power Hostility (all hostile, random, or all friendly)

We’ve had a lot of fun playing with different Legacy Paths on or off in each Age. While Legacy Paths that don’t lead to a Victory are always optional, sometimes it’s nice to just tune them out entirely and focus on playing into the unique strengths of your leader and civ. For a fun sandbox game we’ve been playing in the office, try turning off Legacy Paths for Antiquity and Exploration, and setting the game to Abbreviated Ages. If you want to lean into the sandbox feel even more, try turning off Legacy Paths in Modern and the Score Victory, too. 

This is a step toward giving you more flexibility in how you play, and we know Legacy Paths have more room to grow. Stay tuned for future updates!

### **New Bonuses for Religion, City-States, and Towns**

Pantheons are first come first serve, so to make sure there’s enough to go around, we’ve added two new Pantheons to Antiquity, and these can be selected by more than one player.

We’ve heard feedback from players that Religion in _Civ VII_ has room to grow. One consistent piece of feedback we’ve seen is that there’s not enough reason to convert your **own** Settlements, so we’re adding new Beliefs and updating some existing ones that give bonuses for spreading your Religion within your own empire. We’ve got bigger and bolder changes on the horizon for Religion, too, so we’ll keep you updated on how it evolves!

We’re also introducing updates for Town Focus bonuses to help them feel more impactful. Urban Centers in particular have received a glow-up, and now gain access to many of the Buildings that were otherwise only available in Cities (like Libraries and Monuments in Antiquity). Fort Towns gain the ability to purchase multiple walls so they can really lock down strategic chokepoints. We also introduced a new type of Town Focus: the Resort Town. These relaxing scenic retreats gain extra Gold and Happiness on Rural tiles with Happiness and increased Yields on Natural Wonders.

Lastly, we felt massed Hub Towns were overshadowing some of the other options and gave them a slight nerf from +2 Influence per connected Settlement to +1 Influence. We’re going to keep our eye on them to see how they compare against the other newly buffed Towns.

### **Steam Workshop**

We’ve added a lot of options to customize your experience with this update, but nothing beats the level of personalization you can achieve with the help of our amazing modding community. From UI tweaks to ambitious gameplay overhauls, mods provide a way to really make your gameplay experience unique. So with this update, we're also rolling out Steam Workshop support and an initial version of the Modding SDK.

You'll now be able to find and install mods from the Steam Workshop. Just hit the Subscribe button and your mods will be installed the next time you start up the game! For modders, this of course means your mods will be easier for players to find and download, and you'll be better able to keep the mod up-to-date for your users. Please note that the _Civilization VII_ mods you'll find in the Workshop are created by and for the _Civ_ community, and are not officially supported by Firaxis or 2K. Use them at your own risk!

We’ll also be providing a Modding SDK to help our modding community create, debug, and upload mods to the Steam Workshop. While this initial version of the SDK won't feature art tools, it will include a mod uploader and the (glorious) return of FireTuner. Additionally, we've included some guides and documentation within the tools, if you’d like to learn how to make your own mods.

Last thing – we’ve also uploaded three example mods to the Steam Workshop to show off some of the things you can do with mods, but also as references for both new and more experienced modders on the various ways you can make changes to the game (there are a few neat tricks that weren’t available in _Civilization VI_)! 

A quick reminder for modders:

When you're creating and sharing mods, please make sure your content follows our User Rules (which you can find in Section 6 of our [Terms of Service](https://www.take2games.com/eula/)), for example:

- Don’t use content based on someone else’s IP (like characters, music, or art from other games, movies, etc.) unless you have the rights to use it.
- Keep content safe and respectful, meaning no harmful, offensive, or inappropriate material.
- And of course, no malicious code or anything that could negatively impact the experience for other players.

### **New Loading Screen**

Did someone say **more** Gwendoline Christie VO? 

One of the first things you’ll notice when you boot up 1.2.2 is a refreshed Loading Screen, a small but important step in a bigger effort to improve _Civilization VII’s_ UI. We’ve rethought how we develop the UI, and the Loading Screen gave us a great chance to try new workflows without disrupting gameplay. Highlights include leader portraits front and center, new info panels, a Tips & Hints section, and fully rewritten and rerecorded intros narrated by Gwendoline Christie. Want to dive deeper? [Check out our latest article](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/from-the-devs/) from Firaxis Lead Producer Tom Shaw on this change and what’s next for the UI.

### **Gameplay**

- **New Advanced Game Options** 
    - [★ - Community Influenced Item] Added an option to pick and choose which Legacy Paths are enabled per Age.
        - **Dev Note:** We wanted to give players options for how they could customize their game by allowing them to turn off Legacy Paths of their choice, and allowing them to disable the Score Victory. Note that if you turn off all Legacy Paths, and disable the Score Victory, you can still win the game with a Domination Victory by eliminating all other leaders. We think this change should allow for a cool sandbox experience through the Ages! (Please note that currently these options are only available in Single-player, but we plan to add these to Multiplayer in the future.)
            - Nuclear Fission Tech is added to the Modern Age, so players can still use nukes without completing the Military Legacy Path. 
    - [★] Added an option to disable the Score Victory.
    - [★] Added a new “Custom” AI Difficulty setting that allows the player to choose difficulty options specific for each value.
        - **Dev Note**: With this update, you can set any of the AI bonuses to any level you want individually. Don’t like the economic bonuses the AI has on Deity, but enjoy the challenge in combat? Now you can set up a game to do exactly that!
    - [★] Added an option to pick and choose which Crises you want on or off in your game.
        - **Dev Note:** We’ve always allowed for Crises to be entirely on or off, but wanted to give you the added control to pick and choose which Crises you want to see. If you have more than one Crisis enabled for an Age, then the game will randomly choose one from the pool of enabled Crises.
    - [★] Added an option to Bypass Civilization Unlocks, allowing players to choose any civ for the next Age at Age Transition regardless of any unlock requirements.
    - [★] Added an option to control initial Independent Power hostility. Settling within 5 tiles of an Independent Power will still cause them to become hostile.
        - **Dev Note:** Starting near multiple hostile IPs can make for a challenging early game, but sometimes you just want some space to build out your Capital.

- **Land-Based Treasure Convoys**
    - [★]  Treasure Fleets are growing legs! These will now be called Treasure Convoys, and you’ll be able to use them over land and not just the sea. Any Distant Lands Settlement with improved Treasure Resources now generates Treasure Convoys and no longer requires Coastal access, a Fishing Quay, or the Shipbuilding Tech.
        - **Dev Note:** The Treasure Fleet Legacy path, specifically the gameplay around gathering Resources not immediately available to your empire, is a fun collection minigame for players that like to play the map. While we’ve improved Resource placement further, the steps required to progress this Legacy Path were still quite restrictive and often forced linear play patterns instead of asking for interesting decisions when settling. We’ve made some adjustments that should make it much easier to pursue this Legacy Path, while still requiring you to explore and settle Distant Lands. We plan on continuing to observe this Legacy Path as well as the others to find places to inject strategic variety.
    - Shipbuilding is no longer required to make Treasure Convoys.
        - **Dev Note**: With this change, your Treasure Convoys will start their journey home while the Ocean is still dangerous, and your Units can still be damaged by stormy seas.
    - Fishing Quays are no longer needed to make Treasure Convoys.
    - Updated tutorial and Advisor Quests to remove instances of Fishing Quay being required to spawn Treasure Convoy.
- **AI**
    - AI civs now repair damaged Buildings and Improvements over time in gameplay. 
    - AI will now have better judgement and make smarter deals when negotiating a peace deal.
    - AI players will now activate a Great Person when they create one.
    - AI now prioritizes attacking Enemy Treasure Convoys when progressing through a game. 
    - AI are no longer as aggressive in declaring war on players who are far away from them.
    - AI leaders can no longer build duplicate Buildings when one of their damaged Buildings has a hostile Unit on it.
    - AI civs will no longer build multiple Settler Units and not use them when encountered during late Antiquity gameplay.
- **Cities & Towns**
    - Added a brand new Town Focus, **Resort Town:** +1/2/3 Happiness and +1/2/3 Gold on tiles with Happiness (Natural Appeal). +50% Yields on Natural Wonder tiles in this Town.
    - Redesigned **Urban Center**: +100% Gold and Happiness towards Building maintenance in this Town. You can buy additional Buildings (e.g. Library, Bath, Monuments) in this Town (Was: +1 Science and Culture on Districts with two Buildings in this Town.)
        - **Dev Note:** You can think of Urban Centers like a mini-City – useful for when you want some additional Buildings, but don't necessarily want another build queue to manage.
    - [★] Adjusted balance on several existing Town Focuses: 
        - **Religious site**: +1 Happiness on all Buildings and +1 Relic Slot on Temples in this Town. (Was: +2 Happiness and +1 Relic Slot on Temples in this Town.)
        - **Factory Town**: +100% Gold towards purchasing a Factory in this town. +1 Resource Slots. +5 Trade Range. (From +100% Gold towards purchasing a Factory in this Town. +1 Resource Slots.)
        - **Mining Town**: +2/3/4 Production on all Camps, Woodcutters, Clay Pits, Mines, and Quarries. (Was: +1/2/3 Production on all Camps, Woodcutters, Clay Pits, Mines, and Quarries.)
        - **Hub Town**: +1 Influence for every connected Town (Was: +2 Influence for every connected Town.)
            - **Dev Note:** The only nerf of the bunch, Hub Town has been tuned down slightly to bring it in line with other Towns. We’ll keep an eye on this Focus for further tweaks that may be needed.
        - **Fort Town**: +5 healing to Units and +25 health to Walls in this Town and can purchase additional Walls.
- **Independent Powers & City-States**
    - [★] Added 24 new City-State bonuses across the Ages.
        - **Dev Note**: Bigger maps means more players, and more potential City-State allies. To support this, we added more options for Suzerain bonuses when befriending a City-State. One of these new options is also shareable, so multiple civs can choose it. We felt that having a good baseline option available to all players would be a good quality-of-life consideration. 
        - **New Antiquity City-State Bonuses:** 
            - **Scientific**
                - **Lingua Franca**: +2 Science on displayed Codices.
                - **Archimedes’ Screw**: +1 Science on Warehouse Buildings. This bonus can be chosen by multiple civilizations.
                - **Dev Note**: There are a few new bonuses that stack bonuses on Warehouse Buildings. This is part of an approach we're experimenting with to keep infrastructure Buildings like Warehouses relevant and impactful as more of your empire is swallowed up by urban sprawl.
            - **Militaristic**
                - **Hegemon**: +1 Settlement Limit.
                - **Dev Note**: Some players have asked for more ways to increase Settlement Limit. We’re pretty comfortable with the current limits and how they rein in overly-wide strategies, but this seemed like an appropriately-costed way to give those players an option.
                - **Spoils of War**: +1 War Support. This bonus can be chosen by multiple civilizations.
            - **Economic**
                - **Stockpiles**: +2 Resource Capacity in the Capital.

            - **Scientific**

                - **Mechanization**: +1 Science on Warehouse Buildings. This bonus can be chosen by multiple civilizations.
            - **Militaristic**
                - **Dependent Territories**: +1 Settlement Limit.
                - **Home Front**: +1 War Support. This bonus can be chosen by multiple civilizations.
            - **Economic**
                - **Factory System**: +1 Resource Capacity in Settlements with a Factory.
                - **Entrepreneurship**: +1 Gold on Warehouse Buildings. This bonus can be chosen by multiple civilizations.
            - **Cultural**
                - **Touring Exhibits**: +3 Culture on displayed Artifacts.
                - **Textile Industry**: +1 Culture on Warehouse Buildings. This bonus can be chosen by multiple civilizations.
- **Economy**
    - Made several balance adjustments to Specialists, especially in Modern. 
        - **Free Speech** (Modern Age Civic): +50% Food and Happiness towards maintaining Specialists (Was: +100% Food and Happiness towards maintaining Specialists)

        - **Attribute Node**: 10% Food and Happiness towards maintaining Specialists, or +20% if you have 3 or fewer Cities (Was: 15% Food and Happiness towards maintaining Specialists, or +30% if you have 3 or fewer Cities)

        - **Dev Note**: Another consideration for larger maps and player counts was more Pantheon and Religious Beliefs being chosen. We expanded the catalogue of Beliefs and introduced some shareable options here as well.

        - New Reliquary Beliefs:
            - **Akhlaq**: +1 Relic for first-time Conversion of one of your Cities.

        - New Enhancer Beliefs:

            - **Dev Note:** A strong start is a powerful advantage, and Isabella has been one of the strongest leaders in the game since launch. We didn’t want to remove her power entirely, but instead wanted to spread it out a bit more over the course of a campaign and really give her a reason to seek out and secure as many Natural Wonders as she can.
- **Civs**
    - **Inca**
        - Qhapaq Ñan Tradition now allows players to create Homeland Treasure Convoys worth 2 points in Cities with at least 3 Mountains.

Hey, _Civ_ fans!

We’re rolling out a bonus update for you ahead of our next one in June! This update adds the new Pangaea Plus Map Type, several balance passes to leaders and civs, an expanded human player limit in multiplayer, and addresses a number of player-reported issues. We’ve also continued work on improving the UI, refined AI behavior to make opponents more competitive, and tightened up overall game polish.

**A note for our Switch players**: Update 1.2.1 is now live on Nintendo Switch, including all the improvements in 1.2.0, bringing Switch fully up to date. Scroll down for the full patch details. Thanks for your patience!

Looking ahead, we’ll also be sharing an Update Check-In soon that’ll give you a look into what’s coming next. Until then, here are some things the team is working hard on and planning to include in the June update (subject to change):

- Large & Huge Map Support
- Steam Workshop Support
- Improved Game Setup Options
- New Religious Beliefs and Balance
- New City State Bonuses and Balance
- New Town Specializations and Balance
- Specialist Balance
- Treasure Fleet Improvements
- UI & Quality-of-Life Improvements

As always plans can shift, but we want to get these changes in your hands as soon as we can! 

**And lastly, a few quick notes before you dive in:**

- While we aim to maintain backwards compatibility for existing saves as much as possible, some new abilities or effects may not appear until you start a new game or advance to the next Age in your current campaign. For the best experience, we recommend starting a new game, or continuing your current game into the next Age.
- If you encounter any new bugs or issues, try disabling any mods, as some may not yet be compatible with the latest update. 
- Are you playing on Steam and want to finish your current save under a previous version? You can do so using our Steam beta branches.

Keep on reading for the full Update Notes below, and don’t forget to check out our Developer Update video below to see some of the highlights in action!

## **Pangaea Plus Map Type**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/5kQaIXyiFFy7rwHWQsSoYX/e7a850980ce8c93ccf5e7a809c5527d1/Pangaea_Plus.gif)

Pangea maps have always had a special place in the hearts of _Civ_ players who love a good all-out brawl. Pangaea Plus brings this gameplay to _Civ VII_, with all civs starting on a shared central Homeland landmass surrounded by a scattering of islands. These islands will have Treasure Resources that you’ll want to grab during the Exploration Age.

These contested Distant Lands islands make Naval gameplay especially viable, but be warned - you’ll need to invest in a strong army if you find yourself on this map type surrounded by Xerxes, Amina, and Harriet Tubman.

## **Leader & Civ Balance Pass**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/3hbbsJSeR4Dfku2ZkjLkAN/71305696ff887c3aa322800168a600eb/HimikoAlt.gif)

We’ve been paying close attention to how players engage with our roster of leaders and civs - both through direct community feedback and in-game data. With recent updates to abilities that affect Combat Strength, the introduction of the new Food Curve with 1.2.0, and growing insights into how the Influence Yield is being used across different strategies, we have a better understanding of where certain leaders and civs stand in the current meta. 

Update 1.2.1 introduces some adjustments to a number of underutilized or underperforming options, with the hope of helping abilities stay relevant throughout the game and making each option feel distinct, competitive, and rewarding from start to finish. We included some extra dev notes in this section to give some insight into why these changes were made. We’ll keep on refining balance in future updates, so let us know how things feel! 

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/2SoAgpqXPKB55VNLXkzx3t/afe12c8e801440e20b90390f21025b10/Update_Notes_Header__1_.png)

## **New Features**

- **Pangaea Plus Map Type**
    - Added a new map type: Pangaea Plus. This map type features a single large central landmass that all civs start on. Surrounding islands are Distant Lands to all players and are home to Treasure Resources in the Exploration Age.
- **Increased Multiplayer Player Limit**
    - Increased the maximum number of human players on all maps in Antiquity and Exploration. The max number of players in these ages now matches the number in Modern. Max human player numbers in Antiquity and Exploration are now (Tiny: 4; Small: 6; Standard: 8).*
        - **Dev note:** Players who would not fit on the Homelands are instead spawned in the Distant Lands and can make progress to the Legacy Paths in Antiquity and Exploration. Their progress is now tracked in the Legacy Path screen.

## **Leaders & Civs**

- **Leaders**
    - **Friedrich, Oblique**
        - You now gain an Infantry Unit whenever you complete a Tech Mastery or construct a Science Building instead of just from construction.
            - **Dev Note**: Friedrich is one of our Leaders that rewards you for pursuing specific gameplay goals, and we wanted to make sure the reward was significant enough to feel worth it. Now your scientific focus can help field an army to defend your empire of scholars.
    - **Friedrich, Baroque**
        - You now gain an Infantry Unit whenever you complete a Civic Mastery or construct a Culture Building instead of just from construction.
        - Added +1 Culture per Age on displayed Great Works.
            - **Dev Note**: We continued to mirror the abilities on both Friedrichs, but without the boost to Commanders this Friedrich Persona was falling a little behind. We added a little Culture here to keep both versions even in power.
    - **Hatshepsut**
        - Added +1 Culture per Age for each unique Resource you have instead of +1 Culture for every imported Resource.
            - **Dev Note**: We saw Hatshepsut struggle to use her Unique Ability outside of the Antiquity Age, especially as the war-heavy gameplay of Modern made maintaining Trade Routes difficult. With these changes we hope to continue to incentivize Trade to acquire every kind of Resource, but leave multiple paths to taking advantage of the ability.
    - **Himiko, High Shaman**
        - Added +2 Happiness per Age on Happiness and Influence Buildings.
        - Added +50% Production towards constructing Happiness and Influence Buildings.
            - **Dev Note**: Himiko’s Happiness bonuses were powerful, but a little narrow. We felt expanding her kit to include bonuses on Influence buildings would be a good boost without losing her identity.
    - **Jose Rizal**
        - When gaining Rewards from a Narrative Event, you now gain an additional 20 Culture, 20 Gold, and 20 Influence per Age.
            - **Dev Note**: Influence is a powerful Yield, so we’re careful about how available it is. When looking for a buff to this Diplomatic Leader though, it was a good opportunity to grant it directly.
    - **Pachacuti**
        - Cities now gain a bonus to Production equal to 10% of that City’s Food.
            - **Dev Note**: Pachacuti is a good benchmark for what we want a powerful Food-focused leader to be. With the Food Curve changes and general balance tweaks we’ve made, he was falling behind. This adjustment is a big power boost, and we’ll be keeping an eye on Pachacuti in future updates for any tweaks needed.
    - **Xerxes, Achaemenid**
        - Added +10 Trade Range.
            - **Dev Note**: Xerxes’ focus on Trade works well, but weighing Settlement placement to ensure Trade connections versus good Yields was more often a chore than an interesting choice. The extra range gives Xerxes a little more flexibility to utilize his 'Silk Road' Unique Ability.
- **Civs**
    - **[Crossroads of the World DLC] Bulgaria**
        - The Tarkhan Commander now allows Units to pillage for 1 movement instead of no movement.
        - Swapped the effects of the Krum’s Dynasty Unique Ability that grants Food on pillaging with the 'False Retreat' Tradition that grants Production on pillaging. When Age Transitioning, you’ll now inherit the new 'False Retreat' Tradition that grants Food.
            - **Dev Note**: While it was fun to see strategic players pull off extremely fast wins with this Tradition in Modern, it was not intended behavior. This change lets Bulgaria shine in Exploration without trivializing Modern.
    - **[Crossroads of the World DLC] Great Britain**
        - Increased the Culture provided by Antiquarian Unique Explorer Unit from +5 to +20 for every tile in your Capital when you use the Excavate Artifact action.
        - Financial Centre now gives +2 Gold and +2 Science per connected Settlement instead of just Gold.
            - **Dev Note**: Great Britain focused very heavily on Production and Gold but fell behind in other Yields, so we injected a little Science and Culture as a treat.
    - **Khmer**
        - In addition to the passive immunity to Floods from the Mousong Civic, Settlements with a Baray Unique Building also gain immunity to flood damage. 
            - **Dev Note**: We made this change so that the immunity to river damage could remain after Age transition. Make sure to build your Barays! 
    - **Majapahit**
        - The Pura Unique Quarter now gives an empire-wide discount to upgrading Towns into Cities.
            - **Dev Note**: Majapahit's Unique Quarter was one of the few that didn’t have a passive effect that you retained into the next Age. We added an effect to the Norman Donjon for the same reason.
    - **Normans**
        - The Donjon Unique Quarter now gives a +10% Production bonus towards training Cavalry Units in that City.
    - **Inca**
        - The Terrace Farm Unique Improvement has been redesigned. It now provides a base +4 Food and gives adjacent Buildings a +1 Gold adjacency bonus. It no longer requires a Mountain Tile, and can be built on any Rough terrain without a Feature or a River.
            - **Dev Note**: While requiring a Mountain nearby reflected a historical reality, it got in the way of gameplay more often than not. We considered buffing the Terrace Farm to be extremely powerful to make up for its placement restrictions, but elected to let you play with your civ's unique options more often instead.
    - **Russia**
        - Prosveshchenie Unique Ability was changed to provide +1 Culture and +1 Science on Districts, doubled in Tundra.
            - **Dev Note**: We wanted to double down on rewarding players for prioritizing Tundra tiles when settling.
        - The Obshchina Unique Improvement now provides +2 Culture in Tundra, and +2 Food on all Farms in this Settlement.
            - **Dev Note**: This was a change made to help usability. Modern Settlements often have limited Rural space and trying to place an Improvement down while considering what Improvements were adjacent to it was sometimes frustrating.
        - Addressed a reported issue with the Obshchina Unique Improvement where the Culture benefit was stacking incorrectly when multiple were built in the same Settlement.
    - **Songhai**
        - The initial description you see of Songhai’s abilities now highlights that it can produce Treasure Fleets in the Homelands with the Kanta Civic. The value of these Treasure Fleets was increased from 1 point to 2 points.
        - The Tajiro Unique Unit is now cheaper to produce, with slower scaling on their costs.
        - New Unique Ability: Songhai gains +3 Gold for each Active Trade Route.
            - **Dev Note**: Songhai, like Mongolia, is one of our civs that has an alternate path to Legacy Path completion. We wanted to make sure that was as clear as it is for Mongolia. Additionally, Songhai’s Gold gameplay was powerful when it worked, but could flounder with a bad start. We buffed its Trade gameplay to raise the floor for this civ.

## **Gameplay**

- **AI**
    - Addressed a reported issue where the AI was not using the Great Banker to achieve a Modern Economic Victory under some circumstances. 
    - AI is now more thoughtful when placing Unique Quarters.
    - AI now suffers less damage than the player on deep ocean tiles when playing a high difficulty game.
    - Addressed a reported issue that AI was ignoring enemy Units outside a Settlement when at war and launching an attack on an Enemy Settlement.
    - Improved AI’s Commander pathing to be more adaptable.
    - AI now only offers peace to human players on a team.
        - **Dev note**: If an AI is on a human team, the AI cannot offer peace to others, but can receive peace deals and accept peace for the human team.
    - AI Leaders will no longer fail to immediately attack targetable enemies when having a Ranged Unit on a Settlement's City Center.

- **Military**
    - Secondary Unit Combat Strength effects from all Resources have been removed.
        - Dev Note: Additional bonuses against particular Unit types ended up just making some Unit types like Infantry underpowered in most situations. We’re looking into other ways to differentiate Unit types so that they each have situations where they shine. 
    - Shì Dàfū Unit can now be trained when Cities other than your Capital reach 10 Population during the Antiquity Age.
    - Trade Caravans and Ships no longer receive damage from Plague when a Trade Caravan or Ship passes through a plagued Settlement.
    - Addressed a reported issue where Units failed to gain Combat Strength when the player was adjacent to the Enemy Combat Unit after unlocking Wartime Manufacturing.

Update 1.2.0 - Patch 1 - April 29, 2025

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/4GQV8BYF2IAWBO4YJXF24l/ce8cd089ca3207c2df6e3ee61c9ad7c1/1.2.0_Patch_1.png)

**A note for Switch players**: Update 1.2.0 – Patch 1 will be incorporated into our June update on Nintendo Switch, coinciding with the release of _Civilization VII_ on Nintendo Switch 2. We appreciate your patience! 

Today’s patch addresses some late-game performance drops, brings some stability improvements, and includes a handful of improvements in response to player feedback. We’re also heads-down on our next update, planned for early June, which will include plenty more improvements and updates across the game. Thanks for continuing to share your feedback, _Civ_ fans!

## **Patch Notes**

_*Excluding Nintendo Switch_

Update 1.2.0 – Apr 22, 2025

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/7Hb3lINn4rcFzgJGnsEzIa/ed7f38afc93cbf3a4bf75a492583b475/Update_1.2.0.png)

Hey _Civ_ fans,

We’ve just rolled out Update 1.2.0! This update brings several highly-requested improvements, balance changes, and new features – many of which were shaped directly by your feedback.  

**A note for our Switch players**: Update 1.2.0 won’t be available on Switch just yet, and will be incorporated into our June update when _Civilization VII_ releases on Nintendo Switch 2. We know that’s frustrating, and we appreciate your patience. This extra time allows us to make sure everything will be working as intended for existing Nintendo Switch players, while laying the groundwork for an upgrade path for the future Nintendo Switch 2 release and support for cross-platform DLC ownership. The console-compatible version remains available with full crossplay support with Steam in the meantime (instructions on how to access [here](https://support.civilization.com/hc/en-us/articles/38491526836243-Civilization-VII-Patch-Mismatch-and-Crossplay-Impact)).

In this update, you’ll find the return of Multiplayer Teams, a rework to how Food and growth scale over time, significant updates to Resources, and more. We’ve highlighted the biggest changes in the Feature Spotlight section below, and further down you’ll find the full notes covering addressed issues, AI improvements, UI polish, and several more changes under the hood.

If you read our [April 8 Update Check-In](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-apr-8/), you already know this is part of a bigger development roadmap. Update 1.2.0 sets the stage for a lot of what’s coming next – especially as we continue to refine the core systems, improve the UI and pacing, and support the game with more ways to play.

We’ll keep on listening, iterating, and adjusting as we go – so please keep sharing your thoughts, especially as you dig into new features and changes to systems. Hope you enjoy the update, and read on for the full notes! 

_**A note on mods:**_ _downloaded mods may not be compatible with this update. Keep an eye out for updates from the mod author!_

## **Updates to Resources**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/gxU7a262cvqtNBAN2XGSC/df381d4e19a9f338816d3eb6f4060ba7/Mangoes_800x450.gif)

Big updates have been made to resources in _Civ VII_! Let’s start with the ten new resources we’ve added with 1.2.0, including: Mangoes, Clay, Flax, Rubies, Rice, Limestone, Tin, Llamas, Hardwood, and Wild Game. All of these can appear in the Antiquity Age or Exploration Age, and Rice, Limestone, Tin, Llamas, and Hardwood appear in the Modern Age. These new Resources come with their own effects as well as at least one new narrative event for each. 

In addition to these new Resources, we’re spicing up Resource distribution with **randomized Resource generation**. New placement logic will help keep each Age unique and strategic (don’t worry – the Resources you still need to complete Legacy Paths will still be available!), and certain Resources are now gated by continent or hemisphere, with a change we’re calling “Hemisphere Identity.” 

This update also reimagines how Treasure Resources work. They’re no longer just for Treasure Fleets, but have passive bonuses to your empire and are more clearly divided between Homelands and Distant Lands, with unique icons and tooltips to make their roles clearer. We’ve expanded the list of Treasure Resources too, including Horses, Furs, and Rubies. 

Finally (whew!) we’ve made **balance changes** to existing Resources, like making Dyes more potent for Happiness, turning Fish into a Bonus Resource, and introducing Tin as a new Factory Resource that improves your Growth Rate. 

We hope these updates bring some more flavor and strategy to Resource management, with more improvements and additions to resources still in the works (including improvements to the Resource screen itself). Also, a little hint from the devs about what’s to come… These updates will lay some needed groundwork aimed at expanding the multiplayer player count in the Antiquity Age and enabling “Distant Land starts” in all Ages in a satisfying way. More on that in the future! 

## **One More Turn**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/7uJaNRsjjI1jCgDCU5Uud5/fc7a0cfbf8bd1181b08dbc7e729969d4/One_More_Turn_V1.png)

We know you’ve been waiting for this one: endless play is here! Now, players will have the option to play “**Just One More Turn**” during single-player games at the end of the Modern Age. 

At this point in the game, a victory has already been won, so all other victories will be disabled during this game mode and the Age Progress indicator will turn into an infinity symbol. However, you can still complete the steps for other victories, get the cinematics, and experiment with your empire if you just want to see it play out. You’ll even still be able to grab Legacy Path achievements if you haven’t already. If you do choose to end your endless game, you can do so by selecting “No More Turns” in the game menu!

## **Food and Growth Rebalance**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/7IqH7i1Kmpc3kL1yeQhjzh/78f266b7295631f3ab2861dd0491438a/Population-Growth_1.2.0_V2.gif)

We heard you loud and clear on this one, food and population growth needed some dev TLC. The old system for growth had some bottlenecks, making it a much less valuable Yield compared to Science, Production, Culture, etc. 

So, in Update 1.2.0, we’ve reworked the underlying math to make Food a more reliable and rewarding Yield across the entire game. We’ve removed the hard cap that used to block growth when gaining Food, and changed the way growth scales. Instead of following a cubic formula, where costs ramped up fast, we’ve shifted to a quadratic curve, meaning your Settlements will still slow down as they get larger, but the pacing should feel more natural. 

In a few bullets, here’s the impact you’ll see and feel with this update: 

- Food-focused strategies are finally viable all game long. 
- Food-focused civs and leaders like (looking at you, [Pachacuti](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/pachacuti/)) will feel stronger and more fun to play.
- AI behavior has improved, since they can now leverage high-Food starts and avoid bottlenecks that used to limit their expansion. You may find you even need to turn your difficulty settings down a notch.

Thanks for all the feedback on this, and let us know how this change feels! 

## **Multiplayer Teams**

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/5YPrYtkD0N3kqukqS6DYlz/b4f890e39551425f6676339d53b7fffe/MP_Teams_Names_Removed.png)

Multiplayer teams are officially back! In Multiplayer*, you can now play co-op with a friend or have a showdown with multiple teams facing off against each other. Here are some of the details: 

- Teams share visibility with each other, along with relationships, war status, and alliance status with other leaders.
- When one player wins a victory, the whole team also wins that victory.
- Teammates can perform Diplomatic Actions with each other, with the exception of Espionage Actions.

A couple important things to note: unlike some past _Civ_ games, teams don’t share Tech or Civic progress. We wanted each leader to still feel unique and fully playable – even when you’re working as a team! The same also applies to Legacy Path progress: it’s still your own personal endeavor. 

We hope our MP fans enjoy this feature and we’re excited to hear how it feels in practice. Keep the feedback coming in!

## **New Features**

- **Resources**
    - Added 10 new Resources to the game: Mangoes, Clay, Flax, Rubies, Rice, Limestone, Tin, Llamas, Hardwood, and Wild Game. Each has new effects and can appear in the Antiquity Age or Exploration Age. Only Rice, Limestone, Tin, Llamas, and Hardwood appear in the Modern Age.
    - Added at least one new Narrative Event for each resource.
    - Resources are now randomized on new game starts. Some are guaranteed in certain Ages to enable the Economic Legacy Path in each Age. New placement rules make for more consistent Resource distributions in initial Ages, and more changes between Age Transitions.
    - Some Resources in the Exploration Age and Modern Age related to the Economic Legacy Paths (Treasure and Factory Resources) will now appear on only one hemisphere or the other, requiring you to expand overseas or trade to access them. 
- **Treasure Resources Updates:**
    - Treasure Resources now have passive effects on your empire, in addition to creating Treasure Fleets when improved in Coastal Settlements in Distant Lands.
        - **Dev Note**: We wanted to make these Resources worth improving and protecting even if they didn’t grant you Treasure Fleets on your Homelands.
    - Horses, Furs, and the new Rubies Resource are Treasure Resources now, and will create Treasure Fleets when improved in Coastal Settlements in Distant Lands. Gold, Silver, Cocoa, Spices, Sugar, and Tea continue to be Treasure Resources. Cocoa, Spices, Sugar, and Tea are divided among the major landmasses and islands of the game, meaning each hemisphere will have some Treasure Resources unique to it. 
    - Homelands and Distant Lands Treasure Resources are distinguished on-map with a Tooltip and new symbol on the Resource Icon. 
        - **Dev Note**: Homelands and Distant Lands are from each civilization’s perspective, so your Homelands could be Distant Lands to another civilization.
    - The Distant Lands continent in the Antiquity Age no longer spawns placeholder Treasure Resources for Age Transition.
- **Resource Balance Changes:** 
    - Dyes give +4 Happiness instead of +3.
    - Fish is no longer a Factory Resource. It is a Bonus Resource with the effect: +6 Food in Settlements with a Port, +3 Food in any other Settlement.
    - Tin is a new Factory Resource that grants a bonus to Growth Rate.
        - **Dev Note**: We like the boost of Growth Rate as an effect, but not in the numbers or scale that Fish was granting it.
- **Map Generation**
    - Improved coastal erosion on Continents Plus, Continents, Shuffle and Terra Incognita map types to help break up coastlines more, especially near the poles.

**Gameplay**

- **AI**
    - AI players will now build larger navies when playing on the Archipelago map type.
    - AI players will no longer pick City-State Bonuses that have already been chosen by another player.
    - Improved how AI land Units handle attacks from hostile Naval Units.
    - Improved AI usage of Great People Unique Civilian Units.
    - Addressed a reported issue where AI would sometimes fail to attack nearby Enemy Units while forming Units to attack a Settlement.

- **Age Transition**
    - Addressed a reported issue that could prevent Legacy cards from unlocking during Age Transitions. This is a speculative fix based on an ongoing investigation and may not cover all cases yet – hang in there as we continue to troubleshoot! 

- **Diplomacy**
    - Increased the penalty for being caught stealing Technologies and Civics from 50% of the base cost over 10 turns to 100% of the base cost over 10 turns.
    - Increased the amount of time it takes to steal a Technology or Civic by 50%.
    - Counterspy can now be used against any number of players simultaneously.
    - Added a 30% failure chance to Espionage Actions taken while being counterspied.
        - **Dev Note**: We found that stealing Technologies and Civics was a bit too powerful of a strategy, and there was not enough counterplay or repercussions for doing it. These changes should make it riskier to do in the first place, and not allow a player to steal as many Technologies and Civics throughout an Age.
    - The Influence penalty from conquered Settlements is now properly removed when you lose control of the conquered Settlement.
    - Addressed a reported issue where the reward for Befriending an Independent Power could sometimes fail to be granted.

- **Environment**

- **Economy**
    - Bridges can now be purchased in Towns.
    - Towns with a water-based Building are now considered Coastal and will be connected to Settlements whose City centers are on the same Continent (as seen in the Continents Lens).
    - The cost of upgrading a Town to a City has been increased in the Exploration Age and Modern Age. The base cost and cost per City have been increased by 100 Gold per Age.
    - Removed Happiness penalties for losing trade routes and spawning or resettling Migrant Units.
    - Buildings with increased cost modifiers can no longer be purchased without sufficient Gold.

    - Addressed a reported issue that sometimes caused Merchants to be unable to connect Settlements by building roads within their land trade range.
    - Addressed a reported issue where some Town connections were broken after Age Transition.
        - **Dev Note**: We’re continuing to make improvements here! We are investigating at least one more known issue where the connections will not always update correctly when loading an autosave from the first turn of an Age.
    - Buildings that require a full tile can now be built over tiles with only a single obsolete Building.
    - The Expansionist Legend Attribute now correctly reduces the cost of upgrading a Town.
    - Unique Quarters no longer retrigger their effects again after being repaired.
    - The Manhattan Project can no longer be started by a single player in multiple different Settlements at the same time.

- **Food & Growth**
    - Removed the previous hard-cap effect on Population growth when stockpiling Food. The growth formula now scales quadratically instead of cubically, so each growth event only modestly increases the number of turns until the next Population increase.

    - Independent Powers will no longer be removed after losing all of their Units.
    - Dispersing an Independent Power with a Naval Unit no longer removes adjacent player districts if the borders are touching.

- **Mementos**
    - Addressed a reported issue where Confucius’ Brush and Scroll Memento could cause Food needed to the next growth event to become 0 or negative.
    - The Lantern Memento will no longer grant its effect when not equipped.
- **Military**
    - Packed Units can now be upgraded simultaneously using the Upgrade All button on the Commander that the Units are packed into.
    - The Production cost and maintenance of Cavalry Units have been increased. The Production cost has increased by 10 Production per Age and the maintenance cost has been increased by 1 Gold in all Ages.
    - The Initiative Promotion now applies consistently on Rivers and rough terrain, and continues to function correctly after Age Transitions.
    - Naval Units are now less likely to be placed in inland lakes on Age Transition. On Age Transition, the game now looks for the largest nearby body of water when placing Naval Units.
    - Players now correctly receive an Aerodrome Commander after conquering a City with an Aerodrome during the Modern Age.

- **Religion**
    - Fertility Rites now applies to all Settlements, not just Cities.

Update 1.1.1 - March 25, 2025

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/1HF8SgWFPqHUYlXwgNBEcm/491cec2596b6d605d85641c1294f16e0/Update_1.1.1.png)

Hello _Civ_ fans, 

Update 1.1.1 is here, ushering in a new batch of improvements to _Civilization VII_! This update includes a mix of both free and paid content, with many of the free additions influenced by community feedback.

At the top of the notes, you'll find the Feature Spotlight section, highlighting the major new features and improvements included in Update 1.1.1, along with developer notes offering more context. From there, the full Update Notes detail all the addressed issues and implemented changes for both the base game and DLC.

Lastly, Update 1.1.1 completes the content additions of the paid [Crossroads of the World Collection](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/crossroads-of-the-world-collection/), totaling two new leaders, four new civs, and four new Natural Wonders for those who own it.

We're still hard at work on Update 1.2.0, currently planned to deploy in April (subject to change). For a preview of what we're targeting, you can refer to our roadmap from the [February 27 Update Check-In article](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/), with plans for additional UI refinements, a "One More Turn" option to continue playing after a game-winning Victory, and more. 

You can expect plenty more major updates in the months to come. We're still at the beginning of our _Civilization VII_ journey, and we sincerely appreciate all your support and patience as we continue to refine the _Civ VII_ experience. As always, we're listening closely to your feedback, so please keep sharing your thoughts on the [Steam Discussion forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1295660/discussions/) or our official [_Civilization_ Discord Server](https://discord.gg/civilizationofficial).

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/6MeLK6hop98tHImhNNFkqX/36734e16a20ef69331f0801b462f13a4/1.1.1_Feature_Spotlight.png)

## **Quick Move**

Quick Move is here! This optional setting allows you to disable the movement animations for your Units, making gameplay faster. This is off by default, and can be toggled by selecting the option in game settings. 

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/5ctTt9yIpMJNnomuOQT4nv/7f3d613a5e3d4153e4c06dbd84411a82/Quick_Move_V2.gif)

## **Map Generation**

As we work to add some more flavor and variety to maps in _Civ VII_, we've added in a brand new start position option as the default, called **Standard**. This option is closer to what players will remember from _Civilization VI_ – where continents have a bit more variety and are less predictable.

The existing start position method is now called **Balanced**, and can be selected again at any point in Advanced Options. Balanced will remain the default option in Multiplayer games. We have plenty more planned for map variety, generation, and new maps (including larger maps) so stay posted, and keep letting us know what you want to see! 

## **Settlement and Commander Renaming**

Your creativity has no bounds – and now the same applies to your Settlement and Commander Unit names! You can now choose to rename them by clicking the pen icon in the upper right hand corner of their menus. Whether you're roleplaying a historical empire, naming cities after your best friends, or for the utilitarians among us – naming things functionally based on their status and benefits – we hope you enjoy the freedom to choose!

## **UI Improvements**

We're adding polish (no, not the Jadwiga kind – the UI kind)! With 1.1.1, we've made several UI changes as a part of an ongoing effort to improve the UI in-game. Here are a few highlights: 

**Improve Unit Flag and Health Bar Visibility**

We've made even MORE health bar readability improvements – now visible in the Unit panel! We've also increased the weight on Settlement health bars to make them stand out more from the surrounding buildings.

**Improved Plot Tooltips**

We've improved the tooltip on plots to include how many Specialists are assigned, and are still possible to assign. 

**New “District Under Attack” notification**

You're now alerted when your District's under attack with a notification – which we hope means less surprises when you go to check up on your Settlements.

**New Trade Lens and Ability to Send Merchants from Lens**

You can now see your available trade routes by triggering a new lens on/off via the Lens panel! You can also send Merchants directly to Cities from the panel in any Age, but remember, in those earlier Ages you still have to start the route when you get there.

**Age Progress Now Shows Turns Remaining Until Crises**

No more surprise Crises! New "pips" have been added to the Age Progress wheel in the HUD to show when Crisis will trigger/escalate.

**Restart Button**

Re-rollers rejoice! We've added a new restart button that can be used within the first few turns of a new game, to restart the map with your exact same game settings and civ/leader choices. Note that restart will not be available in certain situations – like when you've already undergone an Age transition or during a network multiplayer game.

These are just the highlights, so be sure to check out the full list of UI improvements in the update notes below. We've still got a lot more to come! Our upcoming updates and patches will continue to make UI a top priority, so we can improve the readability, accessibility, and general ease-of-use for all of _Civ VII_'s features. 

## **New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest**

Last, but certainly not least, Mount Everest has joined the list of Natural Wonders in _Civ VII_. Called Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan, the mountain has long been held as sacred by local populations. Mount Everest provides a range of bonuses to any player lucky enough to settle nearby – +2 Happiness, +2 Influence, and +2 Culture – and reveals all Mountain tiles on your continent when discovered.

## **Leaders**

**[Crossroads of the World DLC*] Added new leader** [**Simón Bolívar**](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/simon-bolivar/)**.**

As the Napoleonic Wars weakened Spain's presence in the Americas, Simón Bolívar, "El Libertador," led forces to liberate the region. With tenacity and charisma, he led his armies to victory, and the people to independence. The instability of newfound freedom proved difficult to overcome. First president and then dictator of Gran Colombia, he failed to fully enact his ambitions. Yet Bolívar remains an enduring example of South American defiance.

- **Attributes:** Expansionist, Militaristic
- **Unique Ability – El Libertador:** Gain a free amount of Support on your wars. When you conquer a Settlement for the first time, it can purchase a Building for free. Can purchase items when in the Unrest status.
- **Agenda – Cornerstone of Freedom:** Increase Relationship by a Medium Amount for having the least Unhappy Settlements. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount for the leader with the most amount of Unhappy Settlements.

## **Civilizations**

**[Crossroads of the World DLC*] Added new Exploration Age civilization** [**Bulgaria**](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/civilizations/bulgaria/)**.**

In the seventh century, the Bulgars crossed the Danube and made the Balkans their own. Their warriors used the mountains to their advantage, scattering larger armies through skill and stratagems. The First Bulgarian Empire ran on conquest, expansion, and the growth of trade. The Second Empire saw the rise of art, literature, and architecture alongside spirituality and monastic traditions. All came crashing down when the Ottomans invaded.

- **Unique Ability – Krum's Dynasty:** Receive Food in all Towns when pillaging Improvements equal to a percentage of the HP or yields gained.
- **Unique Civilian Unit:** Tarkhan (Unique Commander Unit)

**[Crossroads of the World DLC*] Added new Modern Age civilization** [**Nepal**](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/civilizations/nepal/)**.**

Nestled high in the Himalayas, and incorporating both highland Buddhist and lowland Hindu populations, Nepal has clung to its sovereignty despite its precarious location. 19th century Nepal was governed by an autocratic group of families, and guarded by the fierce Gurkha warriors. Following an agreement with the British, they maintained a degree of independence at the crown of the world. 

- **Attributes:** Diplomatic, Cultural
- **Unique Ability – Roof of the World:** All Warehouse Buildings apply to Mountain tiles, but they cost increased Food and Happiness Maintenance.
- **Unique Civilian Unit:** Sherpa (Unique Scout Unit)

Update 1.1.0 - March 4, 2025

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/2lbUDo76Ey2t1TKYayxx1k/7debb97e402f9504545a27c85d3694c1/Update_1.1.0.jpg)

Hello _Civ_ fans, 

**Update 1.1.0** is here - our first major update to _Civilization VII_! This update includes a mix of both paid and free content, with many of the free additions influenced by community feedback. For these extensive Update 1.1.0 notes, we've separated PC and Console into two separate sections so you can easily read them for your preferred platform.

As part of these update notes, we’re introducing a **Feature Spotlight** section, where the developers will dive deeper into new features or improvements being made. The **Update Notes** will cover all the addressed issues and improvements, including changes to both the base game and DLC. And lastly, for those who are excited about paid content additions, a **Collection** section will showcase the newest civs, leaders, and Wonders included in the latest paid Content Collection.

This update also brings a number of addressed issues and improvements specifically for console players. Some of these changes may already be available to PC players, but now all platforms are fully up-to-date. This also means crossplay between PC has been restored across PC, Playstation, Xbox, and Switch, so you can once again enjoy cross-platform multiplayer between PC and these consoles with the latest version of the game.

For a look into what else we’re planning, take a look at our recently released [Update Check-in](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/) detailing some of what you can expect in our next update, and some major features being scoped out for the future.

As always, we’re listening closely to your feedback, so please keep sharing your thoughts on the [Steam Discussion forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1295660/discussions/) or our official [_Civilization_ Discord Server](https://discord.gg/civilizationofficial). 

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/7BqUWyFUH5RBkW9VjU0IqU/e5bc5523d3b825e939b21377ec251e9b/1.1.1_Feature_Spotlight.png)

## Refining the Modern Cultural Legacy Path: Geographic Society 

 ![](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/GD9LvUFudIxdwupVMllJA/ea474689b3f3d5b793d3d190a6b096d7/CivVII_French-Empire.jpg)

If you’ve been chasing a Geographic Society victory, you might have noticed some balance quirks. We made some key changes to improve how this victory feels and plays, including removing the chance for Artifacts to run out in the game, and making it harder for players to breeze through this path when no other players are aiming for this victory. 

Here are those key changes: 

- **Explorer Units now cost more** to slow down early rushes.
- **Fewer Exploration Age artifacts spawn per continent**, making competition for discoveries more strategic. 
- **Natural Wonders can now be studied for Artifacts** - thanks to a new Mastery in the Natural History tech. Each player can collect these new Artifacts once per Natural Wonder.
- **Additional Artifacts can be earned by completing the Future Civic** (repeatable), providing new late-game opportunities. 
- **Additional AI and quality-of-life improvements** around Geographic Society gameplay. 

We hope these changes balance the pacing of the Geographic Society victory – rewarding players who go all-in on Culture while ensuring other leaders still have a fair shot at competing for different paths! We’ll keep monitoring victory pacing across all Legacy Paths and make further adjustments as needed.

## Crossroads of the World Collection* - DLC 1-3

_Civilization VII's_ Content Collections offer additional paid content to expand on the game's foundation and open up new strategic possibilities for building your empire!

Each of these bundles will include six distinct packs of paid content, including new leaders, civilizations, Wonders, and cosmetic bonuses. Buying a Content Collection gets you all six included packs, which will be deployed at different scheduled times according to our content roadmap.

The first half of the Crossroads of the World Collection, our first Content Collection following the launch of _Civ VII_, goes live as part of **Update 1.1.0**.

We also want to reiterate that you can play multiplayer matches with other players whether or not you own any of the same DLC leaders or civilizations.

## Leaders

**[Crossroads of the World DLC*] Added new leader** [**Ada Lovelace**](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/ada-lovelace/)**.**

From childhood, Ada Lovelace inspected the world through a scientist’s eyes. Forging a path between intellectualism and imagination, she applied her mathematical mind to the nineteenth century’s most cutting-edge experiments.

Foreign policy was conducted through economic strategy, extensive diplomacy, and threat of war. The British navy dominated the seas, while at home, society found a new order amid the explosion of industry. Under Pax Britannica, the world followed Britain’s lead.

**[Crossroads of the World DLC*] Added new Antiquity Age civilization** [**Carthage**](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/civilizations/carthage/)**.**

From humble colony to economic hegemony, Carthage rose from the shores of North Africa to dominate the Mediterranean Sea. Its sleek ships ferried goods and riches all over the known world, while at home, the city of Carthage was famed for its master craftsmen and deep agricultural knowledge.

![1.0.1 Patch 2](app://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/QErdlev155n6bAiUzIc8P/97346226569ed7cbc0468491261cacda/1.0.1_-_Patch_2_1920x1080.jpg "1.0.1 Patch 2")

Hello _Civ_ fans,

First off, a big thank you to all of the players that have reached out to us with bugs, comments, and suggestions during the Advanced Access period for _Civilization VII_. We are reading and collecting all of your feedback, and will continue to do so as we [roll out improvements going forward](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/).

Today’s **1.0.1 Patch 2** for PC addresses some player feedback received during Advanced Access and is the first in a series of upcoming patches intended to do so. Stay tuned for larger, more substantive updates to come in the future.

Please continue to send us your feedback on the [Steam Discussion forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1295660/discussions/) or our official [_Civilization_ Discord Server](https://discord.gg/civilizationofficial). 

**Patch notes**

**Gameplay**

**Windows PC/Mac/Linux/Steam Deck**

- Addressed an issue some users reported experiencing that caused Ages in Epic and Marathon speed games to be shorter than intended.
- City States will now turn into Friendly Independent Powers on Age Transition instead of disappearing completely. They will also now start with more units in Exploration and Modern Ages.
- Addressed an issue some users reported experiencing for inconsistencies with Naval Combat. 
    - Naval Units will use the correct Combat Strength values when attacking another Naval Unit in all instances.
    - Naval Units will properly take reciprocal damage after attacking another Naval Unit. 
    - Naval Units will more consistently move into the attacked tile after defeating another Naval Unit.
- Completing the final milestone of a Legacy Path no longer adds Age Progress in the Modern Age to ensure you have more time to complete a Victory.
- Towns will now switch their focus back to Growing town automatically if they are no longer eligible for their chosen Focus (for example, if their population decreases) until they are eligible again.
- Future Civic is now repeatable in all Ages. The cost of Future Tech and Future Civic will now increase more when repeated.
- Addressed an issue some users reported experiencing after too many bonuses to Growth where Food needed for the next Growth Event became negative.
- Improvements to Rail Networks aimed at increasing the reliability of Settlements connecting to the Rail Network over water by building Ports. This should apply as long as the Capital either has a Port or is connected by rail to a settlement with a Port.
- Made improvements to the Loyalty Crisis in the Antiquity Age, including giving the ability to purchase Villas in towns during this crisis, giving another way to manage the happiness of your settlements.
- **A note about cross-play multiplayer:** To expedite updates to the PC experience, we will sometimes deploy patches to PC at a different cadence than we do on consoles - including today's Patch 1.0.1. As a result, cross-play between PC players and console players is temporarily disabled. This will have no impact on console players attempting cross-platform play with other console players, nor on PC-to-PC multiplayer.

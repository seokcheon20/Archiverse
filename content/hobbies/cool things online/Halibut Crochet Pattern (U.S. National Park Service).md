#### Dorsal fin (top fin)

Begin by attaching yarn towards the base of the tail. (Use image below as a reference) You will be crocheting the top fin from tail towards the head. Crochet stitches as evenly as possible across the body.

sc in next 11 st, hdc in next 5 st, dc in next 5 st, tr in next 2 st, 2qtr, tr in next 2 st, dc in next 3 st, hdc in next 2 st, sc in next 8 st, fasten off.

#### Anal fin (bottom fin)

Attach yarn directly across from the start of the top fin, so you will again be crocheting from the tail towards the head.

sc in next 11 st. hdc in next 5 st, dc in next 5 st, tr in next 2 st, 2qtr, tr, dc, hdc, sc, sl st in next 4 st, ch 2, 2qtr, fasten off.

### Repeat all previous steps for the second color.

#### Assembly

**Step 1**: Add safety eyes to the darker side of the halibut. Keep eyes close together.

**Step 2:** Pin both sides of the halibut together as you see fit. This will help everything stay in place as you sew the halibut together

**Step 3**: Cut a long piece of yarn in either color (I stitched my halibut together using the brown yarn). Secure thread at the base of the tail on the top of the halibut (near where the thumb is in the image below) and begin sewing the two sides together using a matress stitch.

Stitch together until you reach the other side of the tail and then begin to stuff the tail slightly.

**Step 4:** Once the tail has been stuffed slightly, sew across to the other side to ensure more stuffing won't go into the tail. Take care to hide the yarn color on the opposite side. This will help with the overall body shape of the halibut.

**Step 5:** Continue using the matress stitch along the top of the dorsal (top) fin from the base near the tail to the end of the fin near the eyes (pictured). Once you have the top of the fins stitched together, begin stitching the base of the fins together. This will ensure the fin has no stuffing and stays flat.

**Step 6:** Attach thread near the base of the bottom fin and repeat the process of step 5 while stitching around the pelvic fin as well. You might find it helpful to slightly stuff the halibut as you stitch. Just leave enough space so that no stuffing will get into the bottom fin.

**Step 7:** Finish stuffing the fish. Pacific Halibut are a species of flatfish, so don't overfill! Finish stitching the head together and fasten off.

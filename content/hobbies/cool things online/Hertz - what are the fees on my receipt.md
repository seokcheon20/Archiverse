## What are the fees on my receipt?

Your rental receipt may include a variety of charges grouped into different categories. Below is an overview of the most common fees you may encounter:

These charges are applied when you first enter into the rental agreement:

- **Rental Rate**: The base rate for renting the vehicle, based on the duration of your rental (hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly). This rate excludes taxes and additional fees.

## **Added Extras**

These are charges incurred during your rental period for any additional products your purchase:

- **Additional Driver**: Fee for adding extra drivers to your rental contract.
- **FPO (Fuel Purchase Option)**: Prepay for a full tank of gas at the time of rental. The price is based on the current fuel price and the vehicle’s tank size. No refunds are issued for unused fuel.
- **EVPO (Electric Vehicle Purchase Option)**: Purchase the state of charge in the electric vehicle’s battery at the time of pick-up. If not selected, you’ll need to return the EV with a battery level within 5% of the original charge to avoid an EV Service Charge (EVSC).
- **LDW (Loss Damage Waiver)**: Relieves you from financial responsibility for damage to the rental vehicle (excluding fraud or misuse).
- **LIS (Liability Insurance Supplement)**: Provides liability protection for bodily injury and property damage.
- **PDW (Partial Damage Waiver)**: Available for insurance replacement rentals to cover your personal auto insurance deductible.
- **PAI (Personal Accident Insurance)**: Covers medical expenses for you and your passengers.
- **PEC (Personal Effects Coverage)**: Covers personal belongings.
- **PERS (Premium Emergency Roadside Service)**: Includes lockout assistance, flat tire service, battery jump, and other emergency services.

## **Service Charges & Taxes**

These are taxes and service fees collected by Hertz on behalf of local, state, or federal governments, as well as other agencies:

- **AFCR (Airport Concession Fee Recovery)**: Reimburses Hertz for fees paid to the airport for concessions.
- **HCFR (Hotel Concession Fee Recovery)**: Reimburses Hertz for fees paid to the hotel for concessions.
- **Energy Surcharge**: Offsets the rising costs of energy for Hertz's operations.
- **VLCR (Vehicle Licensing Cost Recovery)**: Covers vehicle registration, licensing, and related fees.
- **Tourism Fee**: A fee to recover state tourism commission assessments for airport or hotel rentals.
- **Customer Facility Charge/Use Fee**: Collected for new car rental facilities at the airport.
- **State/Local Surcharge**: Fees for state or local taxes or other government fees.
- **Tax**: The applicable sales tax on your total rental charges.

## **Fees Added at Return**

These fees are applied when you return the vehicle:

- **F & S (Fuel & Service)**: Applies if the vehicle is returned without a full tank of gas, and the Fuel Purchase Option was not selected.
- **EVSC (EV Service Charge)**: Charged if the electric vehicle is not adequately recharged, and the EVPO was not selected.
- **Late Return Fees**: Charges for returning the vehicle later than the agreed return time. Returns within 30 minutes are typically fee-free, but late returns of over 30 minutes may incur extra hourly charges. After 1.5 hours, a full day’s rental may apply.
- **Intercity/Drop Fee**: Applied when the vehicle is returned to a different location than specified in the rental contract.

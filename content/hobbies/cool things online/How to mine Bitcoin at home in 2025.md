## Key takeaways

- Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block.
- Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game.
- Pool mining is the most practical way to earn steady payouts at home.
- Cloud mining saves you the hassle but usually isn’t worth the cost.

Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made.

Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like [Strategy](https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-rebrands-strategy-btc-logo), which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that [recently adopted BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/metaplanet-buys-dip-150-btc-purchase) as a treasury reserve asset. 

Moreover, on the regulatory front, the return of a US President Donald Trump administration signals a friendlier stance toward crypto, with talk of rolling back SEC overreach and [possibly supporting US-based mining](https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-promises-crypto-bitcoin-election). 

Across the Atlantic, the [MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets)](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) regulation has gone into effect in the EU, offering clearer guidelines and reducing regulatory uncertainty for retail investors and miners alike.

Then there's the price. Bitcoin finally broke the [long-anticipated $100,000 resistance level](https://cointelegraph.com/news/market-underestimates-bitcoin-returning-uptrend-all-time-highs-crypto-analyst) in early 2025, following a post-halving supply shock and increased ETF-driven demand. As institutions pour in and supply tightens, more individuals are re-evaluating how to get involved.

Whatever your motivation, one thing’s certain: You want to mine from the comfort of your home. 

This article will explain four realistic ways to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025, what gear you’ll need, how much it might cost, and what kind of returns you can expect.

_**Did you know?** Bitcoin mining has developed into a sizable industry, with revenues growing by over 6,700% from 2021 to 2025._ 

## Option 1: Lottery mining – Low power, high risk, rare rewards

If you’re working with a limited budget but still want to try Bitcoin mining, [lottery mining](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-bitcoin-solo-mining-viable) offers an interesting — if highly unpredictable — way.

In July 2024, a solo miner using just three TH/s of hash power — roughly what you’d get from two small USB devices — [successfully](https://www.theminermag.com/news/2024-07-24/solo-bitcoin-miner-block) mined an entire Bitcoin block. The reward was 3.192 BTC, worth over $200,000 at the time. Statistically, that kind of result should take thousands of years. But with some luck and help from the [Solo CKPool](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solo-bitcoin-miner-wins-200k-reward-against-odds) platform, it actually happened.

These wins are extremely rare, but they do happen. And that’s what keeps some people interested.

Most lottery miners use small, low-power devices like the Bitaxe HEX, an open-source miner built with actual Antminer chips. It runs at around three TH/s, costs about $600 and pairs easily with a Raspberry Pi. Another popular option is the GekkoScience R909, a USB miner running at 1.5 TH/s and a favorite among hobbyists. 

These devices aren’t built for steady income. They’re closer to digital slot machines, but ones that still contribute to securing the [Bitcoin network](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-bitcoin-a-beginners-guide-to-the-worlds-first-cryptocurrency).

So why do people do it?

Three main reasons:

- [Running an independent node](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-a-bitcoin-node-a-beginners-guide-on-blockchain-nodes) supports the health and resilience of the Bitcoin network.
- It’s a good way to get familiar with [how mining works](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/how-to-mine-bitcoin-a-beginners-guide-to-mine-btc).
- A single successful block can be worth a lot, and it’s all yours if it happens.

For most, it’s not about making money. It’s about the challenge and the curiosity, like building a custom PC or restoring a vintage radio. And yes, it also looks great plugged in on a shelf, blinking quietly under a glowing Bitcoin lamp.

Next up: ASICs, the heavy-duty hardware of serious miners.

_**Did you know?** Solo CKPool is designed for independent miners who want to submit their shares directly to the Bitcoin network. Unlike traditional mining pools, if you’re successful here, the entire reward goes to you (minus a small pool fee). There’s no revenue sharing, no splitting blocks._

## Option 2: ASIC mining – Solo mining with real hardware

If lottery mining is like buying a single ticket and hoping for a lucky break, solo mining with an ASIC is showing up with a small stack. Your chances improve, but it’s still a long shot.

ASICs — [application-specific integrated circuits](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/asics-vs-quantum-rigs-evolution-in-mining-hardware) — are purpose-built for Bitcoin mining. In 2025, high-end models like the Antminer S21 Hydro deliver impressive performances, reaching around 400 terahashes per second with improved energy efficiency over previous generations.

Let’s look at the numbers.

The Bitcoin network currently runs at around 500 exahashes per second. With one S21 Hydro, you’d control roughly 0.00008% of the [total hashrate](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-bitcoin-hash-rate-and-why-does-it-matter). That gives you odds of about one in 8.6 billion of finding a block on any given day. It's still extremely unlikely, but it's far better than what you’d get with low-power USB miners.

To meaningfully improve your chances, you’d need to scale up.

Running 20 ASICs could put you past eight petahashes per second, enough, in theory, to find a block about once a year. But that setup requires significant capital, proper ventilation or immersion cooling and a reliable energy supply. Even then, outcomes are unpredictable. The Bitcoin network might find several blocks in an hour or none at all.

Still, some miners go this route. The appeal is simple: If you do find a block on your own, you keep the [entire reward](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-block-reward-explained), currently over three BTC, plus [transaction fees](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/transaction-fees-explained). There is no need to split the payout with anyone else.

![A DIY ASIC mining setup](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/802bf8d20c0328a93f6740006c710a0a.jpg "A DIY ASIC mining setup")

But for most people, even those with top-tier ASICs, solo mining remains a high-risk approach with uncertain rewards.

_**Did you know?** The cost of the latest mining equipment has significantly decreased, with prices around $16 per terahash in 2025, compared to $80 per terahash in 2022, enhancing mining efficiency._

That’s why many home miners eventually turn to a more consistent and scalable model:

Joining a mining pool.

## Option 3: Pool mining – Strength in numbers

If solo mining is a long shot, pool mining is the practical alternative. It’s how most home miners approach Bitcoin mining in 2025 – and with good reason.

By joining a [mining pool](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mining-pool), you combine your hashrate with thousands of other participants. When the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is split based on each miner’s contribution. You’re no longer chasing a rare solo win, but earning smaller, steady payouts. It’s more predictable, less risky and not so dependent on luck.

For example, if you’re running an Antminer S21 Hydro at 400 TH/s, that hash power earns you a proportional share of the pool’s rewards. You’ll likely see consistent daily income tied directly to your contribution.

The largest pools today — Foundry USA, Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool — handle thousands of blocks every month. Many offer FPPS (Full Pay Per Share) models, where you’re paid for every valid share you submit, regardless of whether a block is found that day. 

Others use PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares), which only pays out when a block is discovered, but can result in slightly higher returns over time. The choice depends on how much payout fluctuation you're comfortable with.

![Solo mining vs. Pool mining](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/95b8a94e7f0cf7ea0d9e89ebefc004f4.jpg "Solo mining vs. Pool mining")

Setting things up is straightforward:

- Create an account with your chosen pool.
- Point your ASIC miner to the pool’s server.
- Add your Bitcoin payout address.
- Monitor your stats from the pool’s web dashboard.

The returns won’t be massive, but they’ll be consistent, and for many miners, that’s exactly the goal.

But what if you want to skip the hardware, the setup and the electricity costs altogether? What if you want exposure to mining without running a machine?

That’s where cloud mining comes in.

## Option 4: Cloud mining – Mining without the machines

Cloud mining lets you rent hash power from a remote provider, who runs the hardware on your behalf. You don’t have to manage equipment, deal with heat or noise, or worry about electricity costs. You simply buy a contract, and if all goes well, you will receive a portion of the mining rewards.

On paper, it sounds straightforward. You select a provider, choose how much hash power you want to rent, and pay either upfront or through a subscription. The provider takes care of the infrastructure, including maintenance and cooling. In return, you earn a share of the Bitcoin mined, proportional to your rented power.

![Cloud mining visualized](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/8e32a2869a1d35c9907a614da12fa768.jpg "Cloud mining visualized")

But there are trade-offs – and risks.

[Cloud mining](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-build-a-passive-income-stream-from-cloud-mining) has gained a mixed reputation. Over the years, the space has been flooded with questionable operators, unrealistic return promises and outright scams. Many contracts turn out to be unprofitable once you factor in service fees, maintenance costs and the increasing [difficulty of mining](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-explained). You're effectively trusting a third party to operate machines you'll never see.

That said, there are a few reputable providers. Platforms like NiceHash, BitDeer and ECOS have remained active in the space and offer flexible, transparent options. Some let you choose specific coins or pools. Still, even with these more established names, margins tend to be very thin, especially during bear markets or when global hashrates spike.

Cloud mining may be worth considering if:

- You have limited access to cheap electricity or space for equipment.
- You’re looking for a low-effort way to get exposure to mining.
- You view it more as a speculative bet than a reliable income stream.

However, if your goal is consistent returns or hands-on experience, then running your own gear or just buying and holding Bitcoin is likely a better use of resources.

## The bottom line

There’s no single right way to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025. It comes down to what you’re after. Lottery mining is fun and cheap, but the odds are long. Going solo with an ASIC gives you full control and full risk. Mining pools are the go-to for steady, reliable payouts. Cloud mining offers convenience but not much certainty.

If you're in it for the learning, the experience, or to slowly [stack sats](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-vs-satoshi-key-differences-explained) over time, there’s a setup that’ll fit. Just know what you’re getting into and why you’re doing it.

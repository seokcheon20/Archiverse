> You can use Foam for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.
>
> Foam is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and youâ€™re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.

> There is no way to tell when an oyster will make you sick, no smell/ color/ taste difference. But it is still worth it. I have eaten thousands and never gotten sick. So it is rare. ðŸ’¬ [How dangerous are raw oysters? : r/KitchenConfidential](https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/w6wv4y/comment/ihgj48a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

[Oysters and Vibriosis | FoodSafety.gov](https://www.foodsafety.gov/blog/oysters-and-vibriosis)

> Vibriosis is an illness caused by some kinds of Vibrio bacteria. Vibrio naturally live in coastal waters where oysters live. Because oysters feed by filtering water, Vibrio and other harmful germs can concentrate in an oysterâ€™s tissues. If you eat raw or undercooked oysters, germs that might be in the oyster can make you sick.
> 
> CDC estimates that about 80,000 people get vibriosisâ€”and 100 people die from itâ€”in the United States every year. Most of these illnesses happen from May through October when water temperatures are warmer. However, you can get sick from eating raw or undercooked oysters during any month. Raw oysters from typically colder waters also can cause vibriosis.
> 
> An oyster that contains Vibrio doesnâ€™t look, smell, or even taste different from any other oyster. You can kill Vibrio in oysters and other shellfish by cooking them properly.

> darktable is an open source photography workflow application and raw developer. A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.

Shoutout Perplexity for helping me figure out how to use the software.

## Settings menu

There's a little settings wheel on the top of the center bar.

## Shortcuts

![[darktable_image_2.png]]

At the bottom, you can search for actions and shortcuts. Then you can double click on an action to go into "shortcut setting" mode, and then set something. It'll tell you if there are conflicts or something.

I set a shortcut for cropping. 

## Rotate hacks

When in the rotation/perspective view, you can set a box and then tell it to automatically scale it from there. 

Alternatively, you can right click, hold and drag, and that'll set a line in which to horizontally scale it on. 

## Additional shortcuts

w -> shows a preview when you press and hold

I created a shift+w to adjust color calibration. Then you can click the dropper next to CCT: and select a square

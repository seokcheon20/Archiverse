Table below made with the help of [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and [Obsidian Dataview Serializer](https://github.com/dsebastien/obsidian-dataview-serializer). The query:

```
TABLE 
file.folder as "Folder", dateformat(date-modified,"MMM d, yyyy") as "Modified" 
FROM -"tags" AND -#slurp
SORT date-modified DESC 
WHERE file.name != this.file.name AND file.name != "index" AND draft != "true"
```

Fun fact - if I set it up correctly, this page won't show up in Explorer, Graph, RecentNotes, TagList, or Backlinks! Also the folders view and the tags view. The changes are explained [[Hiding tags from various components|here]]. But it *will* show up in search, and also linked to "view more" on the RecentNotes component. If on mobile, the table looks cramped - sorry! To force an update, Command Palette --> Dataview serializer scan and serialize all dataview queries; also I added a Commander button.

Some hidden tags: anything with "exclude" basically

 #graph-exclude #backlinks-exclude #recents-exclude #explorer-exclude

### The table

%% note to self it's finicky with spaces so i was having some trouble but turns out it's bc i had an extra space at the end %%

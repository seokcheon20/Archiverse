## My own notes

Btw to open a "tester" vault go to Command Palette -> open sandbox vault. 

### Calling a custom frontmatter property: 

Just do the kebab-case version of the name. e.g. "date modified" becomes `date-modified`. 

Excluding a tag: do a `FROM -#tag`

The FROM modifier only works with one `AND`. Can't do `FROM x AND x AND x`. 

### Date format

Dataview uses [Luxon tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=table-of-tokens) for formatting. 

Use this by doing something like `dateformat(date-modified, MMM d, yyyy) as Modified`

Not included in the table: if you want to reference a custom file property, you can use the name with spaces replaced with `-`. For example, do `LIST date-created` if the property is "date created".

## How the site is organized

Files go in ðŸ“‚ **folders**: this is determined based on the state that I'm at when the file is created. For example, if I'm on my 2015 Macbook pro, I'll make the file there because I'm probably doing something a bit more specific to that machine. Also, in my head, I'll remember it as "that thing I was taking notes about on this day when using that machine". I have other folders that are very easy to categorize, kind of like a yes-or-no question. Yes, this is a book. No, that is not a hobby. Yeah, that's a thought I wanted to share with the world. 

Files will get ðŸ”– **tags**: since you can give more than 1 tag to each file, these are more flexible, so it's an attempt to organize things by topic.

Created new database in a folder. Go to syncthing and sync the entire folder. Just need the password on both sides.

## Plugins

Find all plugins here: [Plugins - KeePass](https://keepass.info/plugins.html) 

To add in a new plugin, download the plgx file and put it in `$path\KeePass Password Safe 2\Plugins`. Can also return to this folder by going to Tools --> Plugins folder or something. 

For example [KeePass Plugin Step By Step Guide](https://github.com/ligos/readablepassphrasegenerator/wiki/KeePass-Plugin-Step-By-Step-Guide) from the ligos/readablepassphrasegenerator Wiki Â· GitHub. 

- actually have no idea what this one is doing

Another good one: [KeePass Password Counter download | SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepasspasswordcounter/) 

- after right clicking on an entry, you can list all the entries with the same password.

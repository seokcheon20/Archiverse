> [!web] Game anti-cheats blocking Parsec's inputs

> If you're playing a multiplayer game, it may intentionally block Parsec's inputs. Two common examples are Valorant and more recently League of Legends, which both use Vanguard anti-cheat.
> 
> Some game anti-cheats also **run independently of the game** (such as Vanguard) and can also be in effect outside the game. If you suspect an anti-cheat is causing the issue, try to restart your computer or remove the game and the anti-cheat completely.

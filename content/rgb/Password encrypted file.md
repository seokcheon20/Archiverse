To create a password-protected file access system in WSL where the command `cat myfile.txt` prompts for a password and, if correct, displays the file content, a standard `cat` command cannot natively handle password protection. However, this functionality can be achieved by using a simple shell script combined with utilities like `openssl` for encryption or by creating your own password prompt logic.

## Script Example Using Password Prompt

You can make a shell script (e.g., `catpass.sh`) like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -sp "Enter password: " pass
echo
if [[ "$pass" == "YOUR_PASSWORD" ]]; then
    cat myfile.txt
else
    echo "Incorrect password!"
fi
```
- Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with a strong password of your choice.[2]

## Script Example for Encrypted Files

A more secure approach is to encrypt the file with `openssl`, then use a script:

1. Encrypt the file:
   ```bash
   openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in myfile.txt -out myfile.txt.enc
   rm myfile.txt
   ```

2. Make a script (e.g., `catenc.sh`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in myfile.txt.enc
   ```

   - This script will prompt for the decryption password and then print the contents if the password is correct.[2]

## Notes and Limitations

- Regular `cat` can't natively prompt for a password, but shell scripts or use of file encryption achieve the goal effectively.[2]
- For more sophisticated workflows, use Linux tools like `gpg` for encryption or review permissions and security settings.

This approach is effective and widely used for protecting sensitive text files on WSL.

[GitHub - UdaraJay/Pile: Desktop app for digital journaling.](https://github.com/UdaraJay/Pile)

This guy's stuff is really good! Kudos!

## To import a previous pile

Just name the new pile the same folder as the old one, and then select the same parent folder as the old one. It doesn't override your old content. 

## [[Ollama]] and Pile

> local models are primarily supported viaÂ [ollama](https://ollama.com/); run it alongside pile, and set the model names in settings under theÂ `ollama`Â tab. ðŸ’¬ [UdaraJay](https://github.com/UdaraJay) [on Oct 9, 2024](https://github.com/UdaraJay/Pile/issues/102#issuecomment-2403492718)

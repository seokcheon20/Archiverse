## Vocabulary

[Section (bookbinding) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(bookbinding)) : In bookbinding, a section, gathering, or signature is a group of sheets folded in half, to be worked into the binding as a unit.

## Tips for me

When printing double-sided, make sure to select "flip on short side". There's an option in bookbinder that says "flip on long side" but I tried that and it didn't work for me.

Easiest: folio - two pages per side of sheet

Select add cutlines, but it's mostly only relevant for things with more than 2. 

I tried 4 but the text is way to small. 

I think I would prefer no flyleafs.

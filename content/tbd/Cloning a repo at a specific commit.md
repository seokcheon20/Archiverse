[How to git clone a specific commit](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/git-clone-specific-commit-id-single-branch-reset-depth-head-main-master)

```
git clone <repo>
git reset --hard <commit 6-char id>
```

Easy peasy :) 

Alternatively when looking at old commits, there's a button for exploring code at a specific point in time. And you can look at the code that was changed at that commit.

## Firm grip on reality and physics

[RealOrAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealOrAI/) especially with video models like sora 3

Look for inconsistent sizing, glitching, incoherent text in the background. There's a yellowish gpt filter on images apparently? Inconsistent blur

## Good writing skills that demonstrate critical thinking ability

AI slop writing usually is a lot of grammatically correct sentences with little substance behind them. Also a weirdly cheerful, agreeable vibe. To differentiate yourself, write in a condensed manner with true substance.

### Good reading skills

Same as above - to parse through AI writing, you have to look at a lot of text and understand the main ideas. 

## Truth-seeking radar

GPT will "confidently" tell you incorrect things. Learn to understand the claims they're making and then understand what you can prove or disprove with supporting evidence elsewhere.

## Memory

Things on the internet can be retroactively changed or hallucinated. Or faked with video/deepfake. Have faith in your memory to keep track of what actually happened.

## Attention span

as in, keeping up with the kardashians

## With prompting: a firm grip on the basics

It's easier to ask AI to do something when you already know the specifics of what is already possible. Like asking AI to remind you how to pivot a grouped table in pandas. How would you even know what that is, if you didn't know it already?

## The stuff I actually used

[GitHub - itzg/docker-mc-backup: Provides a side-car container to backup itzg/minecraft-server server data](https://github.com/itzg/docker-mc-backup?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-compose)

There's an ngrok section here: [GitHub - itzg/mc-router: Routes Minecraft client connections to backend servers based upon the requested server address](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router) 

Great blog post: [Minecraft Server in Docker: Adulting Made Easy](https://serialized.net/2021/02/minecraft_server_docker/) 

## The good stuff

The OG docker minecraft that everyone uses: [Working with mods and plugins - Minecraft Server on Docker (Java Edition)](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mods-and-plugins/)  [hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server)

A half-working docker thing: [GitHub - FlorianBreuker/docker-ncfs-minecraft-server: A docker hosted minecraft server for people who suffer from CGNAT :)](https://github.com/FlorianBreuker/docker-ncfs-minecraft-server?tab=readme-ov-file)

- I had to modify the docker file bc the ngrok download was too outdated
- Can't get the SRV record to work.. need to debug... (10:53am)2025-04-08

## Extra stuff

[Minecraft server without port-forwarding](https://www.ravbug.com/tutorials/mc-ngrok/) 

Basically just a guide to linking playit.gg: [Making your minecraft server public in 48 seconds without port forwarding - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK5lsDXIFnM)

- [playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) btw
	- 4 servers free
	- 1 firewall
	- 6 firewall rules
	- external domains paid feature (3/month or 30/yr)

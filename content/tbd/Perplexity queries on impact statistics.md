## Can you give a theoretical cost for each perplexity query?

---

While exact costs per query for Perplexity are not publicly disclosed, we can estimate a theoretical cost based on the available information:

1. Hardware and Infrastructure:

    - Each query likely uses multiple GPUs for processing, which can cost several dollars per hour to operate[^8].

    - With 435 million queries per month, the per-query hardware cost is likely in fractions of a cent[^8].

2. Energy Consumption:

    - AI processing is energy-intensive, but the per-query energy cost is likely minimal, possibly in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 cents.

3. API and Model Costs:

    - Perplexity uses various AI models, with costs ranging from \$0.2 to \$15 per million tokens[^5].

    - Assuming an average query uses a few thousand tokens, the model cost per query could be around 0.1 to 1 cent.

4. Search Queries:

    - Each Perplexity request may involve multiple searches, priced at \$5 per 1000 searches[^5].

    - This adds approximately 0.5 cents per query.

5. Operational Costs:

    - Including maintenance, updates, and staff, these costs might add another 0.1 to 0.5 cents per query.

Combining these factors, a theoretical cost for each Perplexity query could range from 1 to 3 cents. However, this is a rough estimate and actual costs may vary significantly depending on query complexity, model used, and infrastructure efficiency.

It's worth noting that Perplexity offers a free tier and a $20/month professional plan[^1], suggesting they've optimized their costs to provide services at these price points while aiming for profitability in the future[^3].

## What about the environmental impact of each perplexity query?

---

While there isn't specific data available for Perplexity's environmental impact per query, we can estimate based on similar AI language models:

1. CO2 Emissions: Each query to a large language model like ChatGPT is estimated to produce between 2.5 to 5 grams of CO2[^p2]. A more precise calculation suggests approximately 4.32 grams of CO2 per query[^p2][^p6].

2. Energy Consumption: AI queries are energy-intensive, with data centers consuming significant electricity. By 2026, data center electricity consumption could double to 1,000 terawatts[^p3].

3. Water Usage: AI systems require substantial water for cooling their servers, which can strain local water supplies[^p3][^p5].

4. Hardware Impact: The production of specialized AI hardware like GPUs involves resource-intensive manufacturing and potentially harmful mining practices[^p5].

5. Comparison: An AI query's environmental impact is notably higher than a standard Google search, which produces about 0.2g of CO2 per query[^p6].

It's important to note that while individual query impacts may seem small, the cumulative effect is significant given the millions of queries processed daily by AI systems. The tech industry, including companies like Perplexity, is likely exploring ways to reduce this environmental footprint through renewable energy use and more efficient hardware and algorithms.

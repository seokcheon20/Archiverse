Yes, there is an even easier tool for beginners than manually issuing certificates: **mkcert**. It's specifically designed to make local HTTPS certificates as painless as possible.

### Why mkcert is beginner-friendly:

- **Very simple install** (just one command on Mac, Windows, or Linux).
- **Automatically creates a locally trusted root CA** and installs it to your system/browser—no complicated OpenSSL steps or browser warnings.
- **One command to generate a valid trusted cert for any local domain or IP** (including `localhost`, local IPs, `.local` or any self-chosen domain).
- No manual configuration of OpenSSL, CAs, or browser import steps needed.[1][2][3]

#### How a typical mkcert workflow looks:

```bash
# Install mkcert (on Ubuntu)
sudo apt install libnss3-tools  # needed for Firefox support
brew install mkcert  # or download binary from the GitHub

# Initialize the local CA (one-time)
mkcert -install

# Make a cert for your service
mkcert yourapp.local 192.168.0.201
# (replace with your service's hostnames / IPs)
# Produces: yourapp.local+1.pem and yourapp.local+1-key.pem

# Mount these certs into your Docker Compose service for HTTPS use.
```

- Your browser trusts these certs, so no warnings.  
- You can repeat this for any Docker Compose-hosted service or local dev site.

#### Other beginner-friendly alternatives:

- **Caddy server**: If you use Caddy as a reverse proxy for your Docker services, it issues and installs its own local certificates automatically for each local site—just by setting up your Caddyfile and visiting the local URL.[4][5]
- **Nginx Proxy Manager**: Has a built-in UI to issue and manage local SSL if using a public DNS name and Let's Encrypt DNS challenge (but for strictly local IPs, mkcert is easier).[6]

| Tool            | Easiest For                           | Beginner Steps                   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| mkcert          | Any local dev, Docker, LAN, or VPN    | 1. Install. 2. mkcert -install. 3. mkcert . 4. Configure service cert/key. |
| Caddy           | Reverse proxy for local apps          | 1. Install Caddy. 2. Set Caddyfile. 3. Visit local domain. |
| Manual OpenSSL  | Advanced users, custom CA             | Command-line, more manual steps  |

**If you want it very easy:** Use **mkcert**. Nearly everyone in the homelab and dev community recommends it for local/trusted certs with the lowest hassle and no browser warnings.[2][3][1]

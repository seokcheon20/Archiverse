Laptop battery

- don't leave it plugged in all the time - sometimes they'll puff up
- Sometimes there's a setting to toggle that will make it only charge up to 60%-ish and then stop. 
- thankfully battery replacements are not too difficult

Phone 

- same as laptop about batteries
	- should really just make a li-ion battery section

types of batteries:

- Alkaline
- Lithium 
- Lithium-Ion
	- apparently you should keep it around 20-80% charged
- Lithium-polymer
- nickel metal hydride
- Nickel Cadmium
- Lead-acid
- lithium iron phosphate
- lithium titanate
- Sodium-ion

EV batteries

- Teslas: nickel-cobalt-aluminum
- Waymo Jaguar I-Pace: Lithium-ion. [Here's the electric Jaguar that Waymo will use for its driverless cars | Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/jaguar-i-pace-electric-waymo) 

> [!web]- Perplexity
> Waymo vehicles use large lithium-ion battery packs—specifically, the Jaguar I-Pace’s 90 kWh battery—which, when involved in a fire, can pose significant dangers due to the phenomenon known as "thermal runaway." During thermal runaway, the battery cells overheat and can ignite neighboring cells in a self-sustaining chain reaction, generating temperatures that can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius. This intense heat can vaporize much of the vehicle, liquify metal components, and release hazardous gases such as hydrogen fluoride and other toxic fumes.
> 
> Electric vehicle (EV) fires, including those involving Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace, are especially hazardous for several reasons:
> 
> - **Extreme Temperatures:** The fires burn hotter and longer than typical gasoline vehicle fires, making them more dangerous for occupants and emergency responders.
> - **Toxic Emissions:** Burning lithium-ion batteries release dangerous gases, including hydrogen fluoride, which is corrosive and can cause severe lung damage if inhaled.
> - **Difficult to Extinguish:** Conventional firefighting methods often fail to put out EV battery fires, sometimes requiring the use of special fire blankets or even burying the vehicle in wet sand for days to prevent reignition[2].
> - **Risk of Reignition:** Even after the fire appears to be out, the battery can reignite hours or days later.
> 
> In summary, Waymo batteries—like most large lithium-ion batteries in modern EVs—are dangerous when on fire, presenting unique and heightened risks to safety compared to traditional vehicle fires.

Puffed up batteries are bad and dangerous - don't electrocute yourself!!! [spicypillows](https://www.reddit.com/r/spicypillows/)

## Most important details
- where
- when
- who
- pricing

## Tips
- assume nobody is reading your messages to any degree of detail
- avoid spam
- ok to make an executive decision
- prioritize most important details, other things can change easily
- be flexible
- it's a lot more cost-effective to cook but labor/time spent
	- A Costco run for a group trip will always magically take 1.5hr... I don't make the rules
- a sedan can fit 5 people but trunk space is more important

## Kind of afterthoughts but important to have
- Emergency contacts
- Locations of fellow drivers
- A group chat
- List of "it would be nice if you could bring this!", like shared sunscreen or picnic blanket or speaker or ball üèà
- A Venmo or Splitwise group to simplify expenses

## The ideal scenario

Get a good grip ü§ö on what people prefer, especially around price range and comfort level. After sufficient gathering of information, just have their trust that you'll come up with a good plan. If one person is in charge, it's easier to ask for thoughts on a full plan rather than building it step by step with input along the way. 

Make sure to be clear about the deadline to flake!

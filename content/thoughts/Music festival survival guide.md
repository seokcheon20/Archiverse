My resume:

- Coachella
- EDC
- smaller 2-day music festivals (1-2 stages)
- Various 1-day multi-performer concerts

> There's nothing better than live music, I think. ðŸ’¬ Sam Palladio (according to brainyquote.com)

## Hydrate or ?

- water backpacks
- any festival worth their money will have water stations throughout
- Passing out from heat exhaustion is NOT cool

## Medical services

- Narcan training

## Security

- Avoid bringing anything sharp
- Or anything too big
- Carrying less is better anyway

## Lockers

## Transportation

You'll probably have to walk some distance to enter the festival. Sometimes there are shuttles. Depending on the geography, this may or may not be worth. e.g. Coachella, it's daytime, if you arrive before 3pm you'll be able to find some parking. Vs EDC, it's suboptimal because someone has to be the designated driver, and also **other** drivers are going to be tired, maybe slightly inebriated, so it's actually really dangerous.

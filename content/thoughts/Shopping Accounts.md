Creating an account (loyalty, member, card, etc) while shopping is just a blatant attempt to get MORE DATA out of you! Everybody is walking data! 

E.g. Target circle - just put in phone number and your purchase is linked to your account. Pros: can see the receipt in your phone and it's easier for returns, since you don't need to hold onto the receipt. Cons: they know where you are and what you're buying. And the deals are awful! It's always "Spend $100 before {date} to get $20 credit"

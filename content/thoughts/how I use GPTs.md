## Perplexity

I find that [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) is really amazing for synthesizing information in hyper specific cases, especially when you've got a whole conversation thread going and keep adding to it. For example, something that I've asked recently is:

1. I have [[Home networking concepts learned through Pi|Pi-hole]] running on my network. What capabilities will adding WireGuard do for me?
2. If I set up WireGuard, do I need to also set up something on my devices?
3. If I don't set up WireGuard on certain devices, will it still use Pi-hole as the DNS server if it's on my network?
4. Given all this, do I need to set up Pi-hole as my DHCP network, or will it work without?
5. Are there any good Docker containers that I can run with Pi-hole and WireGuard simultaneously? 

I loooove Perplexity ðŸ–¤ ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤«should I become a perplexity ambassador?ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤« Sometimes if you keep asking too many questions, the thread starts lagging, or it starts forgetting what we're talking about. 

I've been using Perplexity a LOT when it comes to tackling all my [[Ideas for what one can do with a home server]]. In general, across the internet, there's plenty of guides for everything (and even documentation!), but Perplexity is the safest way to share detailed information about my whole setup and get instructions that take everything into account.

Prime example!

Been doing this in a gpt window that is NOT logged in so unfortunately there is no memory... maybe would've been cool to see how having memory could help. 

Sometimes "no yapping" helps a lot.
